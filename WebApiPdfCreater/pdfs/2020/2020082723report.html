                    <span id="lblExecSummary_Preamble">The information contained within this report has been generated from the responses given by a sample of staff employed by the organisation, to the 'Staff Engagement Quarterly Pulse Survey'.<br />
<br />
The survey consists of 47 questions and is conducted on a quarterly basis, inviting all staff to take part.<br />
<br />
The main aim of the survey is to review levels and trends of staff engagement across the organisation and identify the factors that may be enabling or inhibiting staff engagement.</span>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span id="lblExecSummary_Summary"><p>It
is important to note that this survey was conducted just after the peak of the
COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Overall,
the results of the June 2020 Go Engage Quarterly Pulse Check highlight a high
level of engagement within Bolton NHS Foundation Trust. The overall engagement
score for June 2020 is <strong>4.02</strong> <strong>out of 5</strong>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The overall response rate was <strong>30.99%</strong> based on 1575 completed out of
5082 invited. This was a 2.32% increase on last quarter&rsquo;s response rate of
28.68%. The <strong>Chief Executive and Board
Directorate</strong> had the highest response rate (50%). The<strong> Diagnostics &amp; Support Services Division </strong>had the lowest
response rate (23.41<strong>%</strong>) and therefore
should be treated with caution. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">Engagement Enablers</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>It is important to note that on
average, all of the engagement enablers, feelings and behaviours scored either moderately
or positively. It is not possible to identify significant differences at </span>division/directorate<span> level due
<span style="color: black;">to small numbers and the need to
maintain confidentiality/anonymity of those who completed the survey. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Work
relationships</span></strong><span> has become the top enabler with an average score of <strong>4.12 out of 5</strong>.<span style="color: red;"> </span>This
is significantly higher than the previous quarter. As with previous surveys
there is still a gap at the item-level in this area, with respondents more
likely to agree that &lsquo;<em>I am satisfied with
the level of support I get from my work colleagues&rsquo;</em> (4.21) compared to &lsquo;<em>I am satisfied with the support I get from
my manager&rsquo; </em>(4.03). Many comments reflect the positive support that staff perceive,
particularly from colleagues, e.g. <em>&lsquo;I
want to say that all of the therapy team I have worked with are lovely people
and have welcomed all of the redeployed staff really well into their team. They
were kind and caring and I did learn a lot from them and the experience as a
whole, as I have only worked in another area before&rsquo; </em>but also managers,
e.g. &lsquo;<em>Being able to work flexibly to fit
in with family/home life and know you can approach your line manager if you
have issues on a personal/professional level, and receive support that is best
for your circumstances, rather than just the department&rsquo;.</em></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Some comments relate to negative management
support during the COVID-19 pandemic, with staff noting that their negative responses
are not reflective of how they generally feel e.g. <em>&lsquo;I feel that this survey is probably not reflective of the vast
majority of time&hellip;that I have worked for this trust. I was redeployed due to
Covid-19 and worked in an area that I never have done before and actually
thoroughly enjoyed it, I was made to feel welcome and a valued part of a team
that had been turned on its head in the necessity to respond to the pandemic.
However the way myself and my colleagues have been treated by our management
during this time is frankly unacceptable, I have never felt so disheartened and
demoralised about work&hellip;.I know I am not the only member of my team to feel this
way&rsquo;</em>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The <strong>Chief Executive and Board Directorate</strong> (4.82) and staff with <strong>less than 1 years&rsquo; service </strong>(4.22)
scored significantly higher than other groups in <strong>Work Relationships</strong>. <strong>Finance
and Procurement</strong> (3.80), staff in <strong>Band
1 &amp; 2</strong> (3.92) and <strong>Scientific
&amp; Technical/Healthcare Scientists</strong> (3.86) scored significantly lower
than other groups in this enabler, although these are moderate scores and not
necessarily cause for action. Those with <strong>11-15
years&rsquo; service </strong>also scored significantly lower than other groups in this
enabler (4.06), however this is still a high score. <span style="color: red;"></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Trust</span></strong><span> is now the
second highest enabler with an average of <strong>4.10
out of 5. </strong>This is significantly lower than the previous year but remains a
high score.<span style="color: red;"> &nbsp;</span>The
lowest scoring item is</span> &lsquo;<em><span>I feel
satisfied that I have the right amount of responsibility&rsquo;</span></em><span> (3.97). <strong><span style="color: black;">Medical and Dental </span></strong><span style="color: black;">staff<strong> </strong>scored significantly
higher on <strong>Trust</strong> (4.25) compared to other
groups. <strong>Registered Nurses and Midwives</strong>
scored significantly lower (4.04) than other groups, however this is still a
high score. Staff with <strong>3-5 years&rsquo;
service</strong> also scored significantly lower than other groups (4.04); however,
this is still a high score so no action is needed. </span><span style="color: red;"></span></span></p>
The lowest enabler continues to be <strong>Recognition </strong>with an average score of <strong>3.49 out of 5</strong>. This is significantly
l<span style="font-size: 13px;">ower<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span>than Q1 in 2019. I</span>tem level analysis suggests that staff feel less
&lsquo;<em>satisfied with the extent the
organisation values my work&rsquo; </em>(3.30) than &lsquo;<em>satisfied with the recognition or praise I get from my manager for good
work&rsquo;</em> (3.67).
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Some
comments relating to this enabler suggest that some staff have felt forgotten,
overlooked and not recognised by the Trust during the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g. &lsquo;<em><span style="background: white;">I fe</span></em></span><em><span style="background: white;">el very let down by the NHS
during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Our office was not risk assessed to ensure 2
metres were between myself and colleagues, we were not given masks, hand gel or
any cleaning products to clean our work areas. We have been forgotten and left
on our own&hellip;..We are a large office - the hub of the NHS for booking
appointments / admissions - we have received no thanks or appreciation from senior management. We have never been mentioned in any of the Covid bulletins for the
work we have been doing.</span></em><em><span>&hellip;clerical and admin staff in our office has heard nothing from anyone...&rsquo;</span></em><span> Some
comments also related to not benefiting from donations, e.g. &lsquo;<em><span style="background: white;">Sometimes I
feel that as community staff we are forgotten and this was shown during the
times we should of received free things for example the M&amp;S meal we never
got any of these things delivered to us, even though we have worked throughout
this difficult time working in different ways to deliver care&rsquo;. </span></em><span style="background: white;"></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Staff in the <strong>Chief Executive and Board Directorate</strong> scored significantly higher
(4.18) on <strong>Recognition</strong> than other
Divisions, as did <strong>Medical and Dental</strong>
staff (3.70) and staff with <strong>less than 1
years&rsquo; service</strong> (3.70). <strong>Band 1 &amp;
2</strong> staff (3.28) and <strong>Allied Health
Professionals</strong> scored significantly lower (3.39) than other groups on this
enabler.<span style="color: red;"></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Influence</span></strong><span> is back
to being the second lowest scoring enabler (<strong>3.55 out of 5</strong>). This is significantly lower than Q1 in 2019.
<span style="color: black;">The lowest scoring item is still
&lsquo;<em>The Trust acts on staff feedback&rsquo; </em>(3.22).
It might be interesting to look at how ideas are put into action and how this
is communicated to staff</span>. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Some staff suggest that the Trust could
learn and gather feedback from those who have been re-deployed during the
COVID-19 pandemic e.g. &lsquo;<em>My experience of
redeployment has not been the most positive experience&hellip;. I am only speaking for
myself and I urge the trust to reach out to every redeployed person for
feedback, as I think you would have a range of experiences to learn from&rsquo;</em><span style="color: black;">. Other comments in this area relate
to staff feeling that they are not given input into decisions that are being
made, including how they will be expected to work in the future, &lsquo;<em>We don&rsquo;t feel as involved as we previously
did so in shaping the future of our service&rsquo;</em>. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Staff in the <strong>Chief Executive and Board</strong> Division scored significantly higher
(4.36) on <strong>Influence</strong> than other Divisions.
<strong>Medical and dental</strong> (3.77) and staff
with <strong>less than 1 years&rsquo; service </strong>also
scored significantly higher than other groups (3.73). Staff in <strong>Integrated Community Services Division </strong>scored
significantly lower (3.43), as did <strong>Allied
Health Professionals</strong> (3.47) and staff with <strong>3-5 years&rsquo; service</strong> (3.39), however, these are all moderate scores
and therefore not areas of particular concern.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">Feelings and
Behaviours</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Within the engagement feelings and
behaviours, all scores are at a moderate to high level. Levels of <strong>Dedication
(4.24)</strong>, <strong>Focus (4.07)</strong>, <strong>Discretionary Effort (4.14), Advocacy
(4.09)</strong>, <strong>Persistence (4.06) </strong>and<strong>
Adaptability (4.02) </strong>are all above 4. It therefore seems staff are
committed to the job and willing to put themselves out and go the extra mile in
their roles. Comments that reflect this include, for example, <em>&lsquo;I am more than happy in my job, have a
fantastic supportive team around me, and get great satisfaction from doing the
very best for the amazing patients that I treat&rsquo;</em> and &lsquo;<em>I'm lucky to enjoy my job whatever responsible role I've been in, there
has been a few over recent years. I have a good work life balance and am
enthusiastic about coming to work daily. I can honestly say I have good
resilience and not sure it&rsquo;s just me or what I've gleaned from some excellent
role models with a great work ethic over the years, suppose most of all I&rsquo;m
proud to be a member of the organisation so going the extra mile is not really
a mile at all&rsquo;.</em></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Levels of <strong>Energy </strong>(3.55)<strong>, </strong><strong>Dedication</strong> (4.24) and <strong>Advocacy</strong>
(4.09) are all significantly higher than last quarter, which is very
encouraging. &nbsp;<strong>Energy, Dedication</strong> and <strong>Discretionary
Effort</strong> are however, all significantly lower than they were 12 months ago. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">Friends and
family test</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Levels of staff who
would recommend the Trust as a place to receive care have increased from 79.13%
in the previous survey to 82.75% in the current survey. </span></strong>Comments
reveal that <span>top reasons for this
include <em>&lsquo;high standards of care&rsquo;</em> and <em>&lsquo;caring and dedicated staff&rsquo;</em>. &nbsp;<span style="color: black;">The
<strong>Divisional Management Operations Directorate </strong>were most likely to
recommend the Trust as a place to receive care (100%) followed by <strong>Chief
Executive &amp; Board</strong> Directorate (92.86%). The <strong>Integrated Community
Services Division</strong> were the least likely to recommend the Trust as a place
to receive care (80.16%).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">The number of staff willing to <strong>recommend the Trust as
a place to work has also increased from </strong><strong>67.06%<span> to 72.99%. </span></strong></span><span>Comments reveal that top reason for this is
the Trust is a &lsquo;<em>great place to work</em>&rsquo;.
<span style="color: black;">As before, the <strong>Divisional
Management Operations Directorate </strong>were most likely to recommend the Trust
as a place to work (88.89%) and the <strong>Integrated Community Services Division</strong>
were least likely to recommend the Trust as a place to work (68.02%).</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">Group
Differences</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the group level
differences noted above:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The <strong>Chief Executive and Board</strong> Directorate scored significantly higher
than other Directorates in <strong>Clarity</strong>
(4.49), <strong>Mindset</strong> (4.19), <strong>Resources</strong> (4.36), <strong>Adaptability</strong> (4.23), <strong>Discretionary</strong>
<strong>Effort</strong> (4.62) and <strong>Persistence</strong> (4.50).<span style="color: red;"> </span><span>The <strong>Finance &amp;
Procurement Directorate</strong> scored significantly lower than other groups in <strong>Dedication</strong> (3.98) and <strong>Energy</strong> (3.21); however, these are not
low scores. </span><strong><span style="color: red;"></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Unfortunately, despite positive
improvements last quarter, the <strong>Integrated
Community Services</strong> Division have scored significantly lower in a number of
areas including <strong>Clarity</strong> (3.75), <strong>Influence</strong> (3.43), <strong>Mindset</strong> (3.12), &nbsp;<strong>Trust</strong> (4.00), <strong>Adaptability</strong> (3.96) and <strong>Advocacy</strong>
(3.91); however, these scores are still moderate to positive. At item level,
staff in <strong>ICS</strong> scored significantly
lower than other groups on <em>&lsquo;My manager
involves me in deciding on changes introduced that affect my work
area/team/department&rsquo; (3.37)</em>. Other low scoring items for this Division
include &lsquo;<em>The Trust acts on staff
feedback&rsquo;</em> (3.16), &lsquo;<em>I feel satisfied
with the extent the organisation values my work</em>&rsquo; (3.22), &lsquo;<em>Overall the Trust is fair in the way it
treats and rewards its staff&rsquo;</em> (3.26), and<em> &lsquo;Decisions about people are made using fair procedures&rsquo;</em> (3.28).
Where data is available, this shows that some teams in <strong>ICS</strong> scored between 2 and 3 in a number of areas. A deeper dive into
these results might help to understand where pockets of lower engagement are
within this division, however other teams may also have similar or lower scores
but this data is not available due to low numbers of respondents.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Looking at staff by pay band, those in
<strong>Band 1 &amp; 2</strong> scored significantly
lower in <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Development</strong> (3.45). <strong>Band</strong> <strong>5</strong> staff scored significantly lower in <strong>Discretionary</strong> <strong>Effort</strong>
(4.00) and <strong>Band</strong> <strong>6</strong> staff scored significantly lower in <strong>Mindset</strong> (3.65); however these are moderate to high scores.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Looking at staff groups there are a number
of significant differences. <strong>Registered</strong>
<strong>Nurses</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Midwives</strong> scored significantly
higher on <strong>Dedication</strong> (4.30) and <strong>Focus</strong> (4.15). <strong>Nursing</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Health</strong> <strong>Care</strong> <strong>Assistants</strong> scored significantly
higher on <strong>Resources</strong> (3.87). <strong>Medical and Dental</strong> staff scored
significantly higher on, <strong>Mindset</strong>
(3.90), <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Development</strong> (4.02), <strong>Energy</strong> (3.77) and <strong>Advocacy</strong> (4.40).<strong>Allied
Health Professionals</strong> scored significantly lower on <strong>Clarity</strong> (3.77), <strong>Mindset</strong>
(3.63), <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Development</strong> (3.51) and <strong>Resources</strong> (3.60). This group also
scored significantly lower in <strong>Adaptability</strong>,
3.94, <strong>Advocacy</strong>, 3.95, and <strong>Persistence</strong>, 3.93. <strong>Scientific &amp; Technical/Healthcare Scientists </strong>scored significantly
lower <strong>Dedication</strong> (4.09) and <strong>Focus</strong> (3.88). <strong>Admin and Clerical Staff </strong>scored significantly higher in<strong> Clarity (3.91), Adaptability (4.09) </strong>and<strong> Persistence (4.19)</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Looking at the results by length of
service, staff with <strong>less than 1 year
service</strong> reported significantly higher scores for <strong>Clarity</strong> (3.96), <strong>Mindset</strong>
(3.92), <strong>Energy</strong> (3.72) and <strong>Advocacy</strong> (4.23). This group scored
significantly lower in <strong>Discretionary</strong>
<strong>Effort</strong> (4.04), however this is a
high score. These results are encouraging, particularly as some staff in this
group will have joined the Trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with <strong>1 -2 years&rsquo; service</strong> scored
significantly higher in <strong>Adaptability</strong>
(4.10) and significantly lower in <strong>Focus</strong>
(3.97). &nbsp;Staff with <strong>3-5 years&rsquo; service</strong> scored significantly lower in a number of
engagement enablers and behaviours including <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Development</strong>
(3.54) and <strong>Advocacy</strong> (3.92). However
these are all moderate and high scores. This group scored significantly higher
in <strong>Discretionary</strong> <strong>Effort</strong> (4.23). Those with <strong>11-15 years&rsquo; service</strong> scored significantly
lower on several enablers including <strong>Clarity</strong>
(3.79), <strong>Mindset</strong> (3.62), <strong>Dedication</strong> (4.13) and <strong>Energy</strong> (3.39). However, these scores
are not low. Staff with <strong>more than 15
years&rsquo; service</strong> scored significantly higher in <strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Development</strong>
(3.78).</span></p>

                        Recommendations
                    </div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span>Recognition,
Influence</span></strong><span> and <strong>Perceived Fairness </strong>remain
the three lowest-scoring enablers. Please refer to previous reports for
previous suggestions to help to increase these. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, it
may be that some of the actions implemented to try to improve scores in these
areas have been paused. Now may be a good time to start to consider what
activity can be re-started, as well as harnessing how technology can facilitate
these. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Many
comments refer to working within the COVID-19 pandemic with staff caveating
that their responses have been negatively influenced by this experience. Specifically,
some comments relate to perceived negative support from management and not
feeling informed during this time, as well as negative experiences of being
re-deployed. It might be useful to hold listening events with groups of staff
to further understand their experiences of working during this time, as well
considering ways that help all staff feel to feel valued by the Trust and
recognised for their contributions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Regarding
<strong>Recognition</strong>, some comments relate to
teams feeling overlooked or forgotten during the pandemic, so it might be
helpful to target teams who have been less visible, with activities such as
&lsquo;back to the floor&rsquo; where senior staff visit teams, as well as &lsquo;team
showcasing&rsquo;, where teams host an event to showcase themselves, including thinking
about how technology could facilitate this process. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>A
theme this quarter within the comments was around <strong>Perceived</strong> <strong>Fairness</strong>
relating to pay and progression. Is it possible to review how decisions are
communicated to staff to ensure that they understand these? Or refresher
training for managers on organisational policy and procedures for these areas?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>Regarding
<strong>Influence</strong>, it is recommended to
develop further communications demonstrating that the organisation is acting
upon staff feedback. Communicating survey results can link into this, stating
what actions you plan to take following the results, so that staff are aware
that their feedback is being acted on. As mentioned above, listening events
following the COVID-19 active phase may be helpful, particularly for those who
were re-deployed or work in services which were significantly impacted. We
recommend following this up with &lsquo;we said you did&rsquo; to ensure that feedback is
acted on or acknowledge what cannot be acted on, so that staff feel listened to.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The <strong>Integrated Community Services</strong> Division have scored significantly
lower in a number of areas. The data shows</span>, where possible, which teams
within this division scored lower but this must be treated with caution as
there may be other teams that score equally as low, or lower, that we cannot
see because of small numbers of respondents. Have there been changes or specific
events which may have resulted in more negative scores for staff in this
division, this quarter? You may wish to gather more feedback from this group to
understand what the lower scores are relating to so that interventions can be
targeted if necessary e.g. a listening event for this division or focus groups
to gather qualitative data.<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Finally, staff who are newer to the
Trust (<strong>less than 1 years&rsquo; service</strong>)
are generally scoring more highly across several areas, which is encouraging,
particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It might be useful to
understand why this is the case. What reasons might there be for newer staff
reporting more positive experiences and can this be harnessed? Using the
principles of appreciative inquiry to find out more from this group may
help.<span>&nbsp; </span><strong><span style="color: red;"></span></strong></span></p></span>

                    This Quarterly Pulse Check survey used 47 questions to measure several key factors associated with
                        levels of staff engagement, and factors that are perceived by staff to enable or block their
                        engagement. The results from the survey have been analysed and summarised within this report as follows:

                    There is vast research evidence to suggest that increasing staff engagement can lead to outcomes
                        such as reduction in sickness absence, reduction in staff turnover, increase is staff performance,
                        improvement in quality of patient care and improvements in safe practice. In future reports it will be
                        possible to measure whether trends in these outcomes vary with the results from the quarterly pulse check survey.

I am well supported by my manager and  encouraged to be the best I can be. Even when work gets tough and difficult I feel able to discuss with my manager and be supported as opposed to fear of repercussion. there is a culture that is open and transparent with no blame when things don't go quite as well and also a lot of effort goes in to recognising when staff go above and beyond and excel in the work place - the rhetoric really is the reality!"</em></li><li><em>"I am privileged to work in an area of the Trust that is well respected and valued by clinical colleagues.  There is clear leadership and I feel empowered to undertake my role with the full support not only from my immediate line manager but from other managers and executives in my directorate and from within others areas of the Trust.   My manager also takes the time to regularly enquire about and supports me with my health and wellbeing.

I still love my job without question but the politics in the NHS is kiliing  the NHS ."</em></li><li><em>"I'm afraid I have been deeply disappointed by how our department has treated staff at the beginning of the covid crisis- we were given no guidance, no support, no awareness of our stress or anxiety levels. No one asked how we were feeling or if we had vulnerable people living in our homes. We were simply told to be in the office, all together, keeping busy. The trust sent us apps and advice on mental health but all we would have wanted was a manager to ask how we were and if we needed support. I had to go to my manager and say we were all very uncomfortable and anxious in our cramped office space, with no distancing in place. Only then did things change. Some colleagues have been unpaid for weeks as they had no childcare (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Disappointed with managers recently- meetings cancelled on 4 occasions- and made to feel it is my fault or there has been 'Miscommunication'. Managers appear very confused with own guidance around mask wearing etc. Unprecedented situations- managers giving very short time spans for staff to respond to new guidance- or to write new SOP- whilst still performing all other tasks.  (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"i feel that since we moved into our new building, our team has fallen apart. our manager is never at work and there is no leadership  / communication. I feel that there is a divide between nursing and admin. I feel second class and left out when we are supposed to work as a team. our staff turnover has increased and we are no longer the team that we were before. I feel our manager has made a mess of our department and no longer cares / moved on. "</em></li><li><em>"As we have not had a manager for quite a while we have had to use our own initiative and the staff who have been here the least has had to rely on said team to help us along."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that the term 'immediate line manager' and 'manager' need clarification, as I consider my senior nurse to be supportive and knowledgeable, and to be my 'immediate line manager'.  However, general team management, allocation of duties and responsibility, work flow and workload, needs managing better, as work such as archiving has been neglected over some years, leading to inefficiency and frustration for some staff."</em></li><li><em>"For many years, one individual's actions, processes and attitude have had a negative effect on the AHPs within ophthalmology. I wish the Consultants would come together and take the lead on raising standards. I am often ashamed to work under such poor direction when I know that there are some excellent models of care within the locality. I have no wish to further myself managerially; I am a clinician. I just want the Consultants to be brave enough to lead."</em></li><li><em>"The lack of support and structure due to the fact we have not had a consistent Line Manager over the passed few years, this as lead to us having to make some decisions solely using your own initiative this as made it difficult to work within the department as you were not sure who to contact with any problems that may have a risen.
Just lately the two Specialist Nurses were over seeing us and this was working very well they had put a plan together to carry on managing the dept  but unfortunately were told to step back from the role"</em></li><li><em>"I feel that most of the band 7's on CDS are extremely supportive.  
However I feel that the matrons, head of midwifery, and other senior managers are not supportive.  
We have only just started to see the head of midwifery on the unit and the matrons don't seem to have positive things to say when they get here and always give negative comments, which during these times is not helpful to the team (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I did not feel supported during redeployment  due to COVID 19 outbreak. There was no communication from my line manager with updates whilst I was on the ward. This created a lot of anxiety and stress within work and at home. I feel as though this situation should of been handled better, particularly as the staff on the ward I was redeployed to had no communication that they would be receiving staff from other areas. They had no clue who we were or what we were there to do. I felt like I was dumped in an unfamiliar clinical area to get on with it. Once I was called back to normal duty I was expected to come straight back with immediate effect with no break and time to rest recuperate or to process what had occurred during redeployment. We had no formal debriefing and it is like it never happened. I know my other colleagues that were redeployed feel the same and despite the difficult circumstances it should of been managed better. "</em></li><li><em>"Over the last few months it has not always been easy to get access to management support above my direct line manager reporting. This has lead to frustration and sometimes lack of clarity on the information being shared."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that I have had no solid constructive line / managerial support within the dept for some years now and have worked on my own initiative which I feel exceed without a doubt  my current pay grade."</em></li><li><em>"Working here is horrible, I feel trapped. It was bad even before the pandemic made everything harder. Staff need to be given more by managers. Effort need to be rewarded and if it isn't rewarded, then there's just no use for it."</em></li><li><em>"Throughout the whole covid situation there has been a total lack of communication, respect and care from managers for the staff."</em></li><li><em>"My manager had finished before the pandemic started so we have had no manager until this week and only one sister, I  tried to talk to my matron about these issues but I ended up feeling even worse than I did before, I felt very let down and felt there was no consideration of our feelings at all.

We have been made to feel devalued. at this present time I don't want to be here. I actually feel sick about coming into work.

I previously felt supported during my time in other areas and never had an issue with the trust as a whole.
Unfortunately this is not the case. I have felt a huge shift in my opinion and feelings towards working within this current team. 

I understand the difficulty that has been faced by everyone within the trust due to the pandemic. I was redeployed into another team to help with staff shortages and the expectance of how the crisis may unfold. The only issue being the delayed response/action to enforce social distancing in the team staff room. Other than that my experience was positive. The team had great morale. The team leader gave an update every morning of how the trust was looking. Any other information that needed to be fed back to team. 

I can not say the same about how I am operating now. Having been back for a while now I have felt a complete switch. There is a severe lack of communication from the managers at a time where it is imperative to have a strong leader that communicates to their staff. This has not been done and is currently not happening. Being ask to leave the base at N block and for the managers to not have any say or direction on literally where to go is absolutely unacceptable. The team was left to fend for themselves and literally turn up at Breightmet health centre with where else to go with all there notes. 

From this point there has been a lack of guidance, information, leadership and communication. All aspects that the trust bases its foundations on. I understand that the managers are implementing a new structure to how we will be working and are in the background sorting out issues. But this does not exempt the managers from liaising with the teams beneath them with what their plans are. I feel that we have just been thrown in a little room at Breightmet health centre, which is soon to be needed by its previous team. Only given clinic rooms to share between several practitioners, with only the bare minimum information to go off. I find it as others in the team unacceptable.  "</em></li><li><em>"Our manager and the manager above her are awful. They do not engage with staff in a professional manner. The shout at you across the room and are unwilling to listen to anything our team has to say. Our whole team is unhappy as we are poorly managed and this cannot be good for patient care. Our team is ignored in favour of other teams, we feel like the managers do not like us at all. We have considered a collectible grievance but feel it is a lost cause as all the managers stick together and anything we say will be “unfounded” . A once bustling, happy and productive team has been pushed to the point where we no longer care. Very sad indeed. "</em></li><li><em>"My answers would have been totally different if you had asked me these questions pre-covid. This has nothing to do with my mindset, it's the lack of support/direction & in some cases leadership (I get it from some but not others). Other than the odd e-mail saying are you ok, can you do this? (which always comes from the same manager) nobody from work has kept in touch on a regular basis except for my work colleague (work in the same office) we use Jabber a lot & we sort out our workload & tasks between the 2 of us.  Some of the managers have been rude & unsupportive, we very rarely receive responses from enquiries.
I'm seriously thinking about my future within the Trust, I love my job, I'm good at my job but I'm slowly being demoralised. I feel abandoned, ignored by some (out of sight, out of mind, springs in to my head), not listened too, & totally disrespected."</em></li><li><em>"There has been some very poor and unprofessional management behaviour towards staff in the last couple of years, and the same managers have allowed other staff to behave poorly which has had a detrimental effect to individuals and the department, and the service we provide.

It has been very difficult to remain focussed and in work, however, a period of time being away due to the pandemic and different working arrangements has benefitted me and I think generally will have done the department good for everyone to have a stop and pause which can only be a good thing.  There is however, a long way to go to rebuild Trust.  Our team has recently just before the pandemic been given a new manager, who is very supportive.  Detrimental scores relate to others and not current manager."</em></li><li><em>"Currently do not feel supported at work from line manager/senior manager.

As an enabler of staff engagement, Trust is the strongest unique predictor of Focus – i.e. it has a

in their work.<br/><br/>
Trust is also a strong predictor of Adaptability and Discretionary Effort, and a moderate predictor
Dedication and Energy. Thus overall, it has the potential to have a vast impact on staff engagement.</span>

I don't think there was full comprehension around the difference in my normal role and the role I was going in to. I did not receive basic information around job description and expectations, without approaching team leads for this information. There were clear gaps in my knowledge and skillset which I was able to identify and although asked for support and formal training in developing these skills, this was not acted upon in a proactive manner. "</em></li><li><em>"Being thrown in, as an unqualified member of staff, to an environment, job and team that you do not know, in the high pressure time of Covid-19, is really hard. Redeployment is not like starting a new job- in my case I was placed into a role that was completely different to my own. One which I knew nothing about, had not applied for and had no signed up to. "</em></li><li><em>"Survey response largely reflects managerial role rather than clinical role - can be difficult to answer when you have several different roles."</em></li><li><em>"I have taken on a new role over the previous 2 years and feel that I lacked support or direction in this role or that there has been any fairness in how development has progressed.  Since management has changed, I am hopeful and confident that the support and guidance will be provided and I can start to feel that I am achieving my goals and gain some job satisfaction again."</em></li><li><em>"Lack of understanding of specialist role.
Not fully integrated into community division, although working hard to improve this and highlight any issues.
It feels at times there is a wider agenda around therapies which would impact on our specialist role and dilute what we achieve as a specialist team - this leads to unrest and lack of clarity. Hard to develop some staff in roles when there is a potential for movement of jobs that they are yet unaware of e.g. admin"</em></li><li><em>"I do feel that the trust let me down during the recent covid outbreak. I understand it was an exceptional circumstance. However I was one of the staff that was redeployed at this time, I felt that the communication regarding this was poor. Staff were promised that they would not be expected to work out of their competency level, however this was not what had been communicated to ward staff at the time. I had the courage to stand my ground which caused me additional stress at an already frightening time. I have come to find on my return from redeployment that not all of my colleagues had the same experience and were forced to work out of their competencies and as such their mental health has suffered. If this was to be the case I feel that staff from non ward based areas would have been better having training on more clinical based topics and refreshing skills other than 'how to wash a patient'. "</em></li><li><em>"I feel I have been adaptable and met the challenges posed to me during the crisis, but it has been an uphill battle with a lack of appropriate resources and understanding of my role (part of a larger comment)"</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff have commented on their understanding of what’s going on within the organisation. Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Although information surrounding covid was given to the trust as a whole we were not given information from our manager on the maternity front.
I feel the future of our unit is uncertain as HOM is leaving - unsure who will replace and whether they will be able to undo the damage that has been done (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"From the outset, information and guidance for staff and their service has been poorly communicated (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"The trust, and my department, is generally a good place to work. However, the covid crisis has revealed acute failings - there was a leadership vacuum at the start of covid and no transparency around the Trust's early plans. While I appreciate that a) the situation was ever-changing and b) there is little point panicking grassroots staff unnecessarily early, as a band 8 nurse specialist it was disappointing that even as senior clinicians we weren't informed of plans. 
The problem of bureaucracy is an ever-present NHS problem and I appreciate that it is not unique to Bolton. It would be really refreshing to look at knee-jerk paperwork as an approach to problem-solving and see if this is really effective."</em></li><li><em>"Most of my opinions reflect the changes this team has undergone in the past 9 months, but also the frustrations and inconsistencies in the Covid response in a community setting."</em></li><li><em>"Daily updates around covid-19 have been reducing and sometimes received 1 x weekly, poor communication around this. "</em></li><li><em>"In current times there have been a lot of changes to how our service has been running, these are not always communicated effectively. "</em></li><li><em>" Immediate managers are very supportive but it is not always clear why higher decisions are being made and some initiatives have been of questionable quality. Sometimes there is a sense that boxes are being ticked rather than issues being properly addressed. "</em></li><li><em>"I am currently based on award but my usual area of work is another ward, I think the way my standard ward staff have been treated has been not very nice, the ward was closed and we were moved to a different ward where we got moved each morning, some wards are not very nice and you are made to feel very out of place, we were never told anything about what was happening with my usual ward, we still don't know what is happening we have now all been moved to different work areas after once again being told on the last minute where we were being placed, in what has been a already difficult time this has added more pressure, even our manager has no idea what is happening. A lot of my original ward staff are now off with anxiety issues after the way we have been treated, I understand the trust has to change from time to time but to have been kept informed would have been nice and also now all working in new workplaces but having no idea if I will be staying here or going back to my original ward. The staff on the new ward have been really welcoming and are a great team but at the moment I feel I have no permanent place as I don't know will I be staying or not. "</em></li><li><em>"During my recent redeloyment due to covid the level in information has been substandard. Particulary around PPE although in hindsight i feel management and senior doctors did not themselves know what to do for the best. Information would change, sometimes twice or more a day making it all seem a bit shambolic. I have a shielding wife at home in the highest risk catagory. On my second day in Casualty i was working in the covid bay and providing last offices in resus. My own situation was never risk assessed. That said, it has to be done and we all have to do our best but it has been a very hard time. 

While i feel my colleagues have banded together well in this crisis it has had an effect on all of us. Announcing a pay freeze on international nurses day really summed up how the government feel about the nhs. I feel no-one fights our corner. Ive been a nurse a long time and seen a lot of good work and a lot of bad. Its important to remind ourselves why we do what we do. Looking after people. "</em></li><li><em>"I feel that there have been huge changes within the tier during the pandemic and still ongoing, I do think managers could have communicated on a weekly basis, even maybe as a relatively informal brief email summary of  what each team changes/ successes have been and will be into the next week, for the teams that link and work closely together have a better understanding of what has changed/ new processes to aid communication and understanding between all staff even those not directly involved with changes.
I feel lots of staff are unsure about what changes are/ who to refer to incertain situations as changes have created some overlap and there would be smoother patient interventions if everyone knew how/when to access other teams.

(Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"There was no structures in place when staff were called back from redeployment (i.e appropriate debriefing of staff; re-training; interview for feedback of redeployment experience; too many mixed messages on protocol and policies)"</em></li><li><em>"Too many changes without a valid explanation"</em></li><li><em>"Overall I think that the trust is a good place to work although it must be noted that most of my immediate management is also via the council due to secondment of our service. 

The more negative options ticked have been as a result of the current Covid restrictions on my role. I am extremely proud and grateful that the trust felt that the learning disability team was essential and therefore redeployment was not necessary. 
However, I feel that the way I have been utilised has not always highlighted the need for a therapy focus. The lack of progress in return to anything other than "urgent visits" has been frustrating and I feel that there is a risk that it will be detrimental in the longer term. 
In any further pandemic planning/learning I think it is important to be clearer on the importance of maintaining long term treatment, rehabilitation  and support to prevent deterioration. We also need to have a clear, well communicated action plan which is consistent across all services about how we get back to treatment and hands on support asap for those people for whom virtual support Is not an option.  
I obviously 100% support the need for restrictions at the peak but these are still ongoing in my opinion, to the possible detriment to the service users. "</em></li><li><em>"Don't always get a sense of the vision of the trust and how that fits in with both Government agenda and GM agenda. It seems quite opaque at times leading to a little mistrust. Sometimes there seems to be too ready an acceptance of changes instigated from elsewhere which do not appear sensible or will likely to lead to inefficiency or poorer patient care with no obvious support to try and refuse or amend the changes"</em></li><li><em>"I feel community services are very much forgotten about with lack of communication from any mangers, too many managers in one team leads things to become confused and no direction. Processes and policies clash because of this reason. No development opportunities. One manager looking after too many staff doesn't allow equal time with each staff member, do not feel like you know what is happening in your own team. Over the last 5 years feeling less and less involved in the team with no one really taking on your point off view or spending the time to explain why changes need to be made. Feel totally in the dark since Covid team has been split up in several different directions with several references of the team no longer in existence with out any consultation. Having a manger who understands how the team works as a whole not just the admin division is more beneficial for the team as a whole.  "</em></li><li><em>"I love working at Bolton and feel the Trust is continuously trying to improve.  However recently it sometimes feels that we are being sent emails/communications about what we should be doing but not physically seeing anyone helping to put things in place.  Eg implementing uniform policy or correct wear of ppe. If nobody senior is seen to be asking people to adhere to uniform policy (hair, jewelry) and there is no consequence, it becomes normal to not bother with it and then becomes an up hill battle to get staff to comply without having to continuously ask them.

During covid we have been continuously told to stay 2m apart via email and posters, yet there is never anyone there trying to implement this.  Sometimes a person in a corridor asking people to do something brings it home especially initially, whereas emails and posters get overlooked as time passes.  I understand this is impractical to have someone monitoring this kind of thing all the time but sometimes seeing a senior person or the threat of seeing them every so often can bring it home more and is more likely to be adhered to long term.

Communications during covid have improved as we've gone along however it would've been good to maybe have somewhere to send suggestions or queries to.  Having the ward colour on the update would've helped the people who go onto a lot of wards daily, to know what they were going to and in what order instead of having to waste a lot of time ringing the wards first, and that is only if you are lucky enough to have the phone answered during busy times!

I also think that the smaller/behind the scenes depts. get forgotten about and again I know it is hard to recognize every dept all the time  but when it very rarely happens, staff sometimes become despondent.

All that said, on the whole I love it here and feel we do a lot right."</em></li><li><em>"I was first redeployed to the maternity wards, around march time. This was a sudden decision and didn't give me time to understand, comprehend and appreciate what this would mean for me and my work. I had to quickly hand over my workload and finish as much as I could before leaving within the next few days. I went into the experience with very little clarity and information around what I would be doing and what would be expected of me, though I and my own team had attempted to seek this. However, when I got to the ward it was clear that the communication around our redeployment was little to nothing, as no one on the ward seemed to know that we were coming and what work we were there to complete. I had been told we were assisting as there was a major shortage of staff, however there was surplus staff and very little work to complete. This ended in us being sent back to our team after 2 days. I was then, quickly after, send to another unit. Again, this situation was decided quickly and little information was provided prior to starting- making the situation all the more stressful and worrying. "</em></li><li><em>"Poor communication process on wards that has been shut down. Staffs are left to wonder whether it will re-open again or not. An email on what's going on would be very much appreciated so at least we know our standing.  "</em></li><li><em>"My answers are mainly negative this is due to the way management have worked to bring in major changes while we are attempting to respond to a pandemic, we have been under immense pressure and stress and have had little to no support from senior managers. We are told that the changes they have made are permanent and they do not provide us with any answers as to why these changes are being made. As a team we do not feel we are providing a good service for our patients, there are so many inconsistencies across the district teams they have placed us in. 
I truly believe that our higher management are doing what they like for their own agenda without any regard for how this is impacting staff, they are not listening or responding to feedback, our questions, thoughts and feelings are ignored. 
At present I dislike coming to work, up until a few months ago I loved coming to work and loved my job. I now feel that I don’t know what my role is, I don’t know what changes will be brought in next and I don’t know what team I actually work in. I have no idea what team I belong to and we previously worked in an extremely successful therapy team, we had good outcomes and excellent patient feedback. We have done nothing wrong to deserve our team to be completely torn apart and no longer exist. There is no transparency from anyone as to what the agenda is and more importantly, why. There is no evidence to show that a new way of working was needed. A pandemic has been used to cover up their real agenda and that is truly disgusting. Because of the way they have acted and managed the situation I believe that if we had had an influx of patients as expected we would not have coped due to not being ready with all their changes."</em></li><li><em>"The leadership is really poor in my division. I'm normally really positive, however the current situation is really demotivating, and lots of us are just looking for other jobs outside of the organisation. There is no clarity, you will send an email and get 3 different responses regarding what to do! We are not listened too. An evidence based intervention/programme has been removed and now the managers just want a sticking plaster and dismiss any concerns raised.  I feel that I have gone from doing a really valued job with structure, to feeling embarrassed. I also wanted to note that a horrible email was sent which targeted some individuals and this was not formally dealt with. 

The new CEO seems really lovely, and her emails make me smile, it feels she really wants to improve the FT and is approachable."</em></li><li><em>"'I can continue working for very long periods of time'....this is unclear as to what you mean. Is it hours in the day? Years to work before retiring? Working extra shifts without a break?
Currently displaced from my role, so everything feels very uncertain with no reassurances from managers. No one seems to have a clear picture of the service in the future. I know COVID-19 has had a massive impact but there are a whole team of staff with an uncertain future.
When answering the questions regarding my manager, I don't really know how to answer as I have had numerous managers over the last few months due to moving departments as part of the Critical care support team, with no clear guidance as to who my manager is. Currently feel very unsettled."</em></li><li><em>"I have always been motivated and passionate about my job and have loved coming to work. The last 12 months have  been extremely difficult. The service I worked for has been decommissioned and a new 'vulnerable' families service is to be designed. Unfortunately, the pathway/new service is no clearer despite offering ideas to management and receiving very little feedback. There has been a significant lack of communication and this has led to me feeling deflated, demotivated, and lost, as I have no direction or goal to achieve as the new service has not yet been agreed.  Whilst I appreciate epr and covid have taken priority, we are a year into the contract and have made no progress and this ultimately affects the children and families in Bolton. "</em></li><li><em>"As previously stated in early April I was moved from the hospital site to a community setting with a fellow secretary due to covid19. My line manager is sometimes at the same location but this has been changeable. The psychologists we work for are either working at home or at the hospital so we do not generally see them. The wider group of therapists, assistants etc we used to see daily we no longer see in our building. This means we are disconnected, don't feel truly part of our immediate team and even less so part of the wider picture. I've worked at the hospital site for 22 years and am not enjoying having been moved. I want to be back with my team but there are no immediate plans that I am aware of for this to happen. Communication is more time consuming and processes we have had to put in place are clunky and more open to errors. This is not a very satisfactory way to work 3 months on from when we were moved with no knowledge of when this may change"</em></li><li><em>"During the last few months sometimes myself and the team felt very uncertain about things. We felt that maybe a little more support was needed and we understand it has been a very difficult time for everyone but due the department having a lot of things closed down we have felt a little lost.
Also that when we was told that we was needed over bank holiday we volunteered as a member of staff that does not work weekends I think the enhancement rates were unfair as a HCA band 2 got more enhancement than myself as a Band 4. "</em></li><li><em>"Having to work from home is isolating and verbal communication has been minimal to check on staff welfare. However, I understand that would require a lot of time and effort when everyone who is on site is really busy dealing with the current situation. I know of support services available if needed via the emails sent about this, luckily I'm not in a position to require this but could see how the above could affect staff mental health from lack of welfare checks."</em></li><li><em>"Over the recent weeks there have been many changes happening across the trust and within my therapy team directly. There has been poor and limited communication regarding these changes which has been very difficult for staff within the team and I feel this has contributed to me feeling les satisfied at work. I adapted my role to meet the needs of the trust whilst the COVID pandemic was happening, since this need is no longer needed, I have gone back to my standard role, which I am glad of, however, there is limited patients to see due to the hospital being generally quiet. I am told that I cannot help on the wards when I am not out seeing patients, that I should engage with service development but due to NEW social distancing rules that have come out in the last 2 weeks I cannot sit in the office designated for our team and therefore have no access to a computer to complete any development. 
I feel the trust communications have been poor with regard to COVID updates and guidance and mixed messages are spread throughout departments and wards. The 'daily COVID update' comes out after 4pm every few days and by this time most staff are usually not at work anymore. The trust guidance on many occasions has also been completely different to government guidance and this has been very confusing.
My team leader has been very supportive throughout the COVID pandemic to me and our team and I am very grateful to her."</em></li><li><em>"Communication to admin/clerical often feels lacking.

Moved from department with 1 days notice and 12 weeks later still don't have a base or clinic rooms, line manager is the only person who seems to be trying to resolve this. No member's of senior management have been to speak to us about the plans for the future of the service and no apologies have been made for the fact the service has been massacred. As a small team we have worked really hard to keep our 500 patients informed and treated virtually throughout with little direction from senior management. I and my team feel under valued and overlooked  "</em></li><li><em>"Some of my answers should be taken in context with the fact that I have only started in a new band recently. Training and communication issues are in relation to the many changes we have undertaken in the last few months, in particular covid restrictions, training not available face to face for HR issues, staff working in different places and ways, and changing across onto EPR.  These changes are challenging for everyone but I feel that I have managed well and been very well supported in my new role on the whole. The monthly updates we receive from the trust have been very helpful, as have the constant covid changes and daily updates going on BOB."</em></li><li><em>"Information from management / consultants is not passed down to the secretaries and this does have an adverse effect on our ability to do our jobs efficiently.

There should be an opportunity for staff to ask questions anonymously (as they could do in the past - questions and answers were displayed on the intranet) as I know not all staff feel able to approach line managers.
I feel the intranet could be more up to date.  Often when you are searching for information its not available, non existent or out of date.

There was no communication from my line manager with updates whilst I was on the ward. This created a lot of anxiety and stress within work and at home. I feel as though this situation should of been handled better, particularly as the staff on the ward I was redeployed to had no communication that they would be receiving staff from other areas. They had no clue who we were or what we were there to do. I felt like I was dumped in an unfamiliar clinical area to get on with it. Once I was called back to normal duty I was expected to come straight back with immediate effect with no break and time to rest recuperate or to process what had occurred during redeployment. We had no formal debriefing and it is like it never happened. I know my other colleagues that were redeployed feel the same and despite the difficult circumstances it should of been managed better. "</em></li><li><em>"My comments are directly related to the challenges we have faced during the Covid pandemic.
We have felt that there has been lack of communication and support from senior management throughout the pandemic and this has impacted on staff morale and our service (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Covid pressures have made my/our work extremely difficult. Expectations of staff are not always achievable due to communication issues with others outside my immediate team."</em></li><li><em>"Over the last few months it has not always been easy to get access to management support above my direct line manager reporting. This has lead to frustration and sometimes lack of clarity on the information being shared."</em></li><li><em>"Team is currently undergoing a lot of change, the full plan of what shape the team will be is not being explained to staff, leaving us very unsettled"</em></li><li><em>"There have been numerous changes within the education centre in the last 12 months with colleagues leaving post and several members of staff taking long term sickness absence. The atmosphere is not always positive. Immediate managers are very supportive but it is not always clear why higher decisions are being made and some initiatives have been of questionable quality. Sometimes there is a sense that boxes are being ticked rather than issues being properly addressed. "</em></li><li><em>"Just a thought/observation: Not sure it's reassuring to be asked to put in your grade (especially higher) when they'll only be one or two staff at that grade especially in smaller clinical areas. May stop staff being completely honest especially as their email invite is linked to this site. I understand why the Trust would want to see if responses are attributable to certain grades etc.- but maybe a reassuring message about how the data will be presented to the Trust may be reassuring. If the data states Grades 8 & > in this area state X, it's not that hard to work out who stated X.

Length of service - does this mean overall NHS or at Bolton FT?"</em></li><li><em>"I feel these are good and accurate answers to all the questions asked"</em></li></ul></span>

Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"I see we have lost quality in the service provision we had and the service has now become about statistics regards the number of people we see.(Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I have recently become a team member of ChatHealth which gives a new dimension to my role."</em></li><li><em>"I love my job and I really enjoy working at the Trust.  Thank you for everything that you do for us.  During Covid-19 the communication within the Family Division has been excellent and the Trust has done everything to protect staff.  "</em></li><li><em>"I thoroughly enjoy my job. It is highly rewarding and engaging. I work with an excellent team and feel lucky in my role. My personal experience is good, I have flexibility and support from my line manager- but it is the wider staff group in my department that I am concerned about (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I enjoy coming to work and feel happy in my role!"</em></li><li><em>"I have worked for the trust a number of years , I feel appreciated in my job role , and get good feed back from my colleagues ."</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff commented on how they do not feel positive about where they work.  Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Started with the Trust just prior to covid so has been a difficult transition. "</em></li><li><em>"I have worked for the Trust for 4 years but feel that the team working in special schools is an invisible nuance within the Trust. We sit between health,education and social care and it can get very complicated at times- particularly in the current climate. We are under the children's community team but should work more closely with the 5-19 service but they will not engage with us. We special schools nurses work autonomously on our own and it can be very lonely and difficult. I do not feel part of the school I am based nor fully part of the Trust as it is difficult to engage being based in a school. This can feel challenging at times and has been especially hard for moral during covid19 pressures."</em></li><li><em>"I have found the time during lockdown difficult, especially as my husband is supposed to be shielding (transplant patient). I have been very worried about the possibility of taking Covid home. "</em></li><li><em>"I understand that there are a lot of changes in the trust with the current pandemic, but I do not feel that the measures that are being put in place are always rational. I feel that some of the measures that have been put in place are too much too late. I feel that there are a lot of knee jerk reactions and that these are cascaded down to staff without much thought and no regard in relation to input of staff and the way in which this is to be implemented. I feel that it was an insult for staff who are working hard, that staff who are staying at home have received a letter and chocolates thanking them. I feel that there is a lot of focus on peoples hair colour and if their hair is touching their collar, even though it is tied back and neat, and this is an unnecessary focus as long as staff are neat, tidy and presentable. The staff work hard and when they are pulled up for these minor issues their identity and morale is greatly affected.   "</em></li><li><em>"My role has changed with business continuity/covid and I've had to be very flexible and cope with daily change, working within a service where processes are being developed alongside the daily work and are changing constantly, constant uncertainty and supporting staff with well-being. Whilst, my mangers are very accessible and try to be as supportive as they can - it can feel isolating working away from the main hub and having no support on sight. Temporary accommodation and challenges ongoing with building and space. Change in working patterns and expectations. Too much work to process and can lose track of what priorities need to be, which can change on a given day.   "</em></li><li><em>"I have found the time during lockdown difficult, especially as my husband is supposed to be shielding (transplant patient). I have been very worried about the possibility of taking Covid home. "</em></li><li><em>"Speaking with students whom are BAME and also to the trust, I feel ashamed and angry of how BAME mothers/families and staff are treated by the general workforce. We have a high BAME demographic in Bolton, with a higher than national average in the Indian and Pakistani population. However this is not reflected in the workforce of midwifery. As a trust we need to be actively promoting midwifery as a career in the BAME communities. We need BAME staff to be given time to do recruitment work, working towards building a diverse, multicultural and multi lingual workforce that can raise cultural awareness and understanding. The staff BAME forum at present is unsure of its aims and goals, and can be dominated by a select few, there is a hierarchy and bureaucracy here that is a direct reflection of the trust senior management."</em></li><li><em>"It has been difficult to stay motivated and engaged during this time of uncertainty - I feel like I cannot switch off at home or at work and I am in a constant state of anxiety - I feel like I need time off on sick but unfortunately have triggered and am worried about the consequences - I am trying to speak to people at home about my worries but feel like it all becomes a bit 'too real'."</em></li><li><em>"Co-vid used as an excuse to force through major changes in working practices/places of work. We have been told that the changes that were short term solutions to Co-vid, are to 
 be permanently implemented.   We have been told that "quality of treatment doesnt matter any more". "There is also no such thing as patient choice any more".   These are direct quotes from management.    "</em></li><li><em>"At present I'm going through the change ??? 
but don't feel I get enough support from the hospital with 
uniforms ect I would recommend district nursing to my friends and family as a place to work but would be unsure about the hospital ."</em></li><li><em>"the majority of my answers are very personal in light of  how it has affected how I feel now about my role, the MSK service and the future.  If COVID had not happened, my answers would have been very different. "</em></li><li><em>"The team I work in has undergone a significant period of change over the past 9 months prior to COVID. Whilst I acknowledge that a period of change is always going to cause unsettlement I feel that the team are in a worse position in terms of moral, enthusiasm and desire to work for the trust than ever before. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Don't look forward to going to work because you don't know what situation you're going to walk into, also, the mood of your colleague, if they're in a bad mood it affects oneself."</em></li><li><em>"I am extremely concerned about how the implementation of Parking Eye will make my day to day work as a community nurse with a hospital based office almost impossible. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Usually I look forward to coming to work, and thoroughly enjoy my job. I am very proud of my role and the team. However, these past few weeks - months have been very difficult and staff morale has been low. I hope that once we have an outcome and able to move forward, that this will relieve stress and increase morale."</em></li><li><em>"I love my team and manager but feel a lack of support from wider trust and management has influenced my responses in a negative way. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Working through the pandemic has been awful. I think I had Covid no testing at that time. I came back too soon as I was worried about my team. I feel worse about everything than I did at the peak in April."</em></li><li><em>"Safety and well being of staff not a priority in this Hospital."</em></li><li><em>"After 35 years in the NHS in various roles I am actively looking forward to taking early retirement. It saddens me that I am so disheartened by my job that I see no alternative but to quit at the earliest opportunity."</em></li><li><em>"During the pandemic we are not able to see patients as a result I am sat in a clinicroom with hardly any work, this is becoming very depressing as I do not see any members of my team throughout the day. I almost feel like I am in a cell. Other colleagues are not like this, as they are in clinics where they do see other team members, still abide by social distancing & are able to joint work. I am very isolated. For me this has been the case since before the pandemic & after months has become mentally very challenging."</em></li><li><em>"My responses to this survey are very different to how i have previously responded in the past. I normally enjoy my job, feel enthusiastic about it and respond more positively to this survey. This is missing at the moment and I am not gaining the same level of meaning, satisfaction or enjoyment from my job. I am not currently looking forward to being in work. It is a difficult time. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Also less emphasis on targets/ patient FLOW and more emphasis on patient CARE, I think its been lost along the way (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"There have been a lot of changes on my ward in last few weeks and morale is very low. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I love my patients and I love caring for them but it has become increasingly impossible to do this due to a combination of lack of staff and an increase in very aggressive patients that take up most of our time on a shift. They are also a great risk to us and other patients. A lot of the time we are unable to give other patients the proper care. It seems we are expected to do more than is possible. I do my best, but it is impossible at times. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff commented on their ability to achieve their work objectives. Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"It is very hard to dedicate a consistent amount of  time required to complete my tasks and feel I achieve my goals effectively due to frequent interruptions, last minute calls to meetings at different sites, frequent change of plans from higher management & much time in travelling between sites"</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff commented on their ability to overcome challenges and setbacks. Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"I am new to the role of practice educator after the 3 previous PEFs left within the space of 2 months due to different reasons and I have found that starting a new role during COVID has proved difficult, with numerous responsibilities being added on the role whilst trying to learn the original role but this has also shown me how resilient I can be and also allowed me to tap into my colleagues experience, guidance and advice around different aspects of theirs and my  roles. I feel confident that, although I don't know the full role yet, my colleagues and manager will assist me to develop and grow."</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff feel confident in the future of the organisation.  Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"I have been working for the Trust now for over 40 years, but have recently taken flexible retirement now working 3 days instead of 5 days a week, and in all the time I have been working at the Trust I have seen many many changes in terms of improving the way we work, and am now looking forward to what the future brings in terms of technology."</em></li></ul><br/>Other comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"We are working from home at the moment, the help we are getting is OK"</em></li><li><em>"The negative answers given regarding my own working abilities are due to current health issues not issues within the area I work."</em></li><li><em>"The Trust has made significant improvement in EDI in the last few years, but there is still much work that needs to be done.  "</em></li><li><em>"I feel I always have adequate opportunity to rest at work and have chance to eat lunch.
I can be prone to getting easily upset if things are not going well and this sometimes affects my ability to get things done."</em></li><li><em>"The last few months have been very challenging, trying to balance child care and working from home, and our own personal mental stresses of the current pandemic we are facing.
Work has been busier than ever it feels, with changes being added and made on what feels like a daily basis, it feels like some days it has all just been to much to take in, resulting in feeling very stressed and anxious. which is something I don't normally suffer from.
My team leader has been good and has acknowledge how people are feeling within the team but that doesn't stop the work load building up."</em></li><li><em>"It is very hard to dedicate a consistent amount of  time required to complete my tasks and feel I achieve my goals effectively due to frequent interruptions, last minute calls to meetings at different sites, frequent change of plans from higher management & much time in travelling between sites"</em></li><li><em>"I feel these are good and accurate answers to all the questions asked"</em></li></ul></span>

Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"I do feel that the trust let me down during the recent covid outbreak. I understand it was an exceptional circumstance. However I was one of the staff that was redeployed at this time, I felt that the communication regarding this was poor. Staff were promised that they would not be expected to work out of their competency level, however this was not what had been communicated to ward staff at the time. I had the courage to stand my ground which caused me additional stress at an already frightening time. I have come to find on my return from redeployment that not all of my colleagues had the same experience and were forced to work out of their competencies and as such their mental health has suffered. If this was to be the case I feel that staff from non ward based areas would have been better having training on more clinical based topics and refreshing skills other than 'how to wash a patient'.

IT is not very efficient in the community and we are not able to keep up with the IT changes which are taking place in the hospital.

We persevere because we put the children first, but we also have no choice.  We have no choice than to continue to work long periods and be immersed.  Time goes so fast because we are so so stressed.  I've worked here 20 years and its only got worse and no one seems to be able to change it or pay attention to it or give it any respect."</em></li><li><em>"Some of the systems at Bolton are quite inhibitory. 
Particularly IT (digital dictation is constantly poor and video conferencing / remote learning support is lacking).
Guidelines ratifications process needs better streamlined and administrative support."</em></li><li><em>"I am generally very happy in my work environment. I enjoy direct patient contact and sometimes feel the administrative duties impact on time available to spend face to face with patients."</em></li><li><em>"Also Increased workloads on a continuous level is leading to reduced patient care particularly with regards to end of life patients who deserve better.

However, on visiting the IT Department there seems to have been significant investment in IT equipment in that area - all workstations equipped with two large monitors. Also the IT Department put up barriers when new equipment or new ways of working such as new analysers are required. There is far too much bureaucracy, including collection and reporting of data with little apparent benefit. Previous initiatives with regards to lean working have apparently been abandoned."</em></li><li><em>"Meeting the multiple demands of the role can be challenging. The working environment can make it difficult to concentrate which can inhibit productivity. The changing workload to meet expanding capacity demands has been challenging which has impacted staff morale."</em></li><li><em>"In addition to my comments above I feel that facilities to take a break or have a quick drink are inadequate in Bolton One Health Centre. The staff canteen, which is fine, is on the top 3rd floor so by the time I get my things together  half of much 30min break is gone by the time I walk through all the doors and around the building. On any other floor there  is not a room for the staff. There is a one small cupboard room with hot water tap which is not sufficient for the number of staff especially now during "Covid-19 pandemic" . It is one in one out awkward system and there is not a space for a breather or lunch break etc. 
One hears a lots of comments from dissatisfied rushed staff especially clerical staff and overall I feel down after a day's work as it is not a happy place to work. I wish I had never left my previous job however I will be trying to change asap."</em></li><li><em>"The dining facilities at the Hospital fail at every level as a staff canteen. It is a great support to staff in pressured roles to be able to take a meal break in their peer group out of the public gaze. It helps them to deal with the stresses of the job to have genuine down time. Sadly the previously excellent canteen services no longer provide an appropriate place. This was true before the pandemic. "</em></li><li><em>"The main problem at present is the lack of IT to support distance learning in the community. At Breightmet HC there is very poor Wi-Fi signal and inadequate hardware to support virtual group meetings so our governance and multiagency working as well as teaching roles are being significantly affected. We need reliable acces to Zoom, Microsoft Teams, WebEx etc"</em></li><li><em>"Changes to the estate resulting in lack of office and clinical space has been very challenging and the uncertainty and length of time it is taking to secure the future provision of  appropriate faculties is causing concern around the future quality of our service."</em></li><li><em>"Difficulty with resources/clinical space and a feeling that your work is not a priority and a lack of responsiveness. 
Caseloads are very high and this can cause stress on staff  (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Community staff are very hard working often working in very high temperatures and now need to wear masks often in homes with heating on .... could the trust not provide the same uniform in a lighter breathable material that will enable staff more comfortable and better working conditions.

Communication has poor at best and this has left a lot of stress in the work place. We are quite ill equipped to complete our work. There's no WiFi for instance where I work, there's not adequate portable devices yet we are expected to be contacting patients via phone or video. The estate is inadequate making it difficult to even adhere to the current COVID directives on social distancing. Communication on PPE has been confusing at best especially in  community centres."</em></li><li><em>"During the pandemic it has been harder to work at full pace in full PPE especially in the hot weather we have been having, summer uniforms would help with this, myself and my colleagues all agree the uniforms are too thick In this heat especially when paired up with an apron, face mask and gloves"</em></li><li><em>"Our department have recently been moved (at the beginning of the COVID19 outbreak to a much smaller officer, from 18 working computers to 1!, we had the option of some of the staff working from home and some in work so some of our staff worked in difference offices across Pikes Lane Centre.  We now don't have the offices available to work in now and only have use of 1 computer (with an additional computer in the consultant rooms at various times in the week).  This was only supposed to be temporary, but 3 months later we are still in the same position, but we are expected to carry on running the service as normal, this is no way acceptable, I do understand that have to adapt to COVID19 and the changes that it makes, we were happy to do this, but now I feel we have been ignored, we need a proper base."</em></li><li><em>"A lack of staff resources can make the job very challenging. Furthermore, estates has been a challenge very recently. The response to COVID-19 and facilitating homeworking has been excellent. The introduction of Attend Anywhere hasn't been without challenges but has meant some face to face patient contact could remain whilst keeping people safe. I have personally enjoyed using it to provide assessment/treatment for patients. However, I have concerns that this would become a normal way of working and I don't think it should entirely replace in person consultations. "</em></li><li><em>"The safety measures within our office/area have only been risk assessed this week, 3 months after the initial lockdown which I find extraordinary.
During the crisis since March, I feel as a District Nurse, we were just told to get on with our job (even without adequate PPE early on) whereas other areas within the multidisciplinary team seem to have completely shut down, expecting us to do their work for them at times (for example, dietitians, podiatrist to name just a couple).  The GPs also treated us like this, dictating what we should be doing from telephone consultations with patients without understanding the full implications of what it entailed within our job parameters.  All with very little thanks or recognition ‘from above’.  As a team, we pulled together as we always do, thankfully with no illnesses and just got on with the job, with much appreciation and praise from our Manager."</em></li><li><em>"My responses differ significantly from previous feedback provided. I have always enjoyed and looked forward to my job, and have always been positive about the contribution I and the team make. During covid 19 I have been proud of the teams approach to be flexible and provide what ever has been needed.  This has meant that the team moved out of accommodation quickly to meet the pandemic demand, and adapted to providing 7 day cover for staff support, and adjusted face to face appointment to telephone appointments where possible.  This required the team to work flexibly and under pressure. In the height of the pandemic this was appropriate and my motivation to do this was high and I adapted to working from home in far from ideal conditions. e.g. lack of technology etc.  This was ok when I felt this would be a temporary situation.  Trying to re-establish services for patients has been difficult, the difficulties with technology persist and are extremely tiring.  Everything takes longer, for example having to type letters due to the lack of G2 means that assessment appointment  take double the time and this slows productivity.  On a positive note we are now able to use attend anywhere and have booked clinics, but this clinic space does not allow you to provide a fully operational clinic, and things continue to take a lot longer, which is draining for everyone.  In addition, the lack of certainty about having a base in the future is unsettling for all staff.  "</em></li><li><em>"In community we have been almost completely ignored during the Coronavirus pandemic. At the end of March we were each given one bottle of alcohol gel and one pack of wipes for each office. Packs of wipes were available if needed. People were worried and sometimes upset about having to come into work - a small meeting room was made available as a 'Lavender' room, that has since been taken away. On 18th June all the fabric covered seating in the staff room was deemed 'not for use' wooden tables and single chairs were placed sparsely. We were also instructed to wear face masks. We all feel that this is 3 months too late - never in 25 years of service have I felt so low and unappreciated. It's as if in community we are invisible. The trust used to be a much better place to work."</em></li><li><em>"The service has no base, we are not adequately resourced to work from home (e.g. completing patient telephone appointments on my own personal mobile, using my own laptop without access to LE2 or G2 dictation, still waiting for IT set up to host Webex meetings, etc). Although I appreciate some home working is likely to be required going forward. Now there is also some use of bookable virtual clinic rooms at J Block but again no access to LE2 or G2 dictation so I then have to return home to type my own letters meaning that I am seeing less patients and waiting times are increasing. I fully understand the need to work with extraordinary measures at the peak of Covid pandemic and I have been committed to working as efficiently as possible during this time without complaint. However with no resolution to this situation on the horizon, it's becoming increasingly difficult to remain positive and hopeful. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Like most, have had a stressful time during COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to staff uncertainty with PPE and social distancing in the office which has caused anxiety with staff and managers."</em></li><li><em>"The lack of IT facilities is a frustration, we are missing out on the National conversation as we have not been given the IT support to be able to access virtual meetings from work (although I can do this from home it is not always practical for me to be at home at the required time)"</em></li><li><em>"During this Covid period, one of my roles requires me to deal with the outpatients, their representatives and staff. I feel very let down, especially during the peak that we were not given or advised to wear any protection until much, much later when things started calming down which I feel was little to late, not to mention being forced to walk a one way system exposing us to a much higher number of people and putting those people at risk too, and because our door was next to the main entrance we then had to pass all the patients and visitors who we were meant to avoid because of the one way system, to get into pharmacy. Thankfully but again much later on we got our own door made in another location which is very sensible and much more safe. I felt unprotected and very exposed to the virus more so than I should have especially with not being ward based during the peak. "</em></li><li><em>"COVID has also caused a lot of fear and anxiety, especially with not being allowed to wear the PPE that would be most effective against us contracting the virus. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"During the Covid outbreak I do feel that the Health Centres have been somewhat ignored.
It is only in the last few weeks that reception has been given protective screens, there are no hand gels on the walls for patients to use when entering the building, which many have commented on.
We are currently using chairs as a barrier to stop people from coming too close to the reception area.
Nothing else has been offered by either the Trust or those responsible for the building."</em></li><li><em>"In light of the recent pandemic my department has not taken adequate steps to ensure social distancing/ safety. We are still all sharing office equipment and only recently have been told to make sure we all social distance, e.g spacing out tables in our break room/ limiting the number of people aloud in the kitchen,"</em></li><li><em>"I feel measures that have been implemented re. social distancing etc have been far too late and they way they have been brought in has been poor. I think other services that have not been hospital based have been forgotten about. "</em></li><li><em>"I feel very let down by the NHS during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  Our office was not risk assessed to ensure 2 metres were between myself and colleagues, we were not given masks, hand gel or any cleaning products to clean our work areas.  We have been forgotten and left on our own.  As a team we have worked together and throughout the pandemic, none of us have been off with any covid symptoms.  This is through our due care and attention, not the NHS looking after its staff.
We are a large office - the hub of the NHS for booking appointments / admissions - we have received no thanks or appreciation from the senior management.  We have never been mentioned in any of the Covid bulletins for the work we have been doing.  
We ensured no patients came in to the hospital when the pandemic started, we cancelled thousands of appointments by changing them to telephone / video appointments.  We cancelled hundreds of admissions in to hospital and adapted a new way of working very quickly.  
During the peak we moved to working 5 days over 7 to help with a moments notice.  
Week 12 of lockdown we were issued with masks - this I feel was an insult.  Like all of a sudden we matter.  Personally I feel we were only issued masks because of the track and trace app going live.  Should one of us be off with symptoms, then the whole office would have to isolated - meaning there would be no-one to do the work.
I am not taking anything away from the front line staff who have been amazing and of course, getting them set up with PPE was the priority, but the clerical and admin staff in our office has heard nothing from anyone.  I feel the NHS has let down its own staff - not a great example to set to our patients.  "</em></li><li><em>"During this current lock down I do not feel that we are effective as we are not able to see our pt's in a face to face situation, as they are predominately over 85 years then the use of technology is not wide spread in this pt group. The constant telephone reviews are boring and the accuracy of reporting from the pt is not clear."</em></li><li><em>" We have literally just received hand gel and wipes 12 weeks into this, throughout the whole thing we have cleaned our own desks and provided our own gel and wipes, nothing was done before that to protect us at all until this last week 15/06, we have all taken great care at our own expense to ensure our office was kept clean etc, they even stopped the cleaners coming in every day and cut it down to 3 times a week, bins were having to be emptied by ourselves!  As an employer we would have expected the NHS to be outstanding and organised in providing staff with adequate gel and wipes and ensuring the workplace is clean rather than leaving it to the staff! (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Haven't felt fully supported over the pandemic. At the very beginning we were left to carry on as usual without any regard to staff safety, even though we were made aware that other staff members of the community had several tests. Had no FIT testing in our team, none offered. None of the equipment issued at the beginning was in date or suitable to fight the pandemic. Also when members of the team tested positive for COVID 19, no deep clean was carried out.  Only now are we getting visits from upper management which are now due to track and trace. Again we feel no support given. Community nurses feel let down as no facilities available at weekend to use the toilet or cooking facilities. We have to travel miles to a second health centre to obtain these facilities and now due to track and trace we are infiltrating another 'bubble' when we are supposed to be social distances.  "</em></li><li><em>"I am really lucky to be an LD practitioner as I feel our approach to how we work with our cohort of patients and families is extended to the team and so my experience of working for the Trust is largely positive. I do feel concerned we have no base at present; this is due to a team taking over our office as they support the Trust to discharge patients (rightly so this is a priority and support this) however as time goes on and our families are sinking into further crisis it is getting more difficult to work as effectively as I would like even given the Covid situation. As a service and individuals we have worked flexibly and now have the benefits of remote working, but as a specialist service I would hate for the importance of a base for the team to be lost as this will impact on staff and families "</em></li><li><em>"During the current covid situation staff have gone above and beyond duty. Yet, as a department that are unable to maintain social distancing it was the end of May before protective face coverings were introduced. This survey has been completed giving an overall view and not just for the current working practices due to covid. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"During the period of huge change in the 0-19 service we have, as a team, faced great adversity.  Our service to our families as a team has been our priority and we have gone above and beyond to deliver the best care possible. This has not been recognised by senior management and was actually dismissed when raised.  The challenges now continue with COVID-19 and I feel as a community service we have been forgotten.  We have had no support from the community infection control team and have been provided with PPE that was useless, the aprons ripped as you tried to open them.  We have managed the situation as best as possible so far with some of us working from home when able.  We have now been told, after 11 weeks of lockdown, that we have to be strictly 2m apart in the office which means only 2 out of our team of 10 can be in the office, this is not sustainable as a team, nor is working in a mask all day when we are making and taking phone calls all day.  Now more than ever we rely on the support of colleagues in the office on a day to day basis.  The light-hearted chatter and gossip is so important at this time as an antidote to the pressure and stress of COVID-19.  I have worked during this stressful period with virtually no staff in the office due to the virus and it makes a challenging and difficult job even more so.  When you have an amazing team who are supportive of each other it makes all the difference.  This does not work the same when individuals are working from home.  It is also important to acknowledge that working from home poses many challenges for us.  For myself home is my sanctuary, more so than ever at the moment and my place of refuge from the madness of the world.  I do not want work encroaching in that space.  My home is small and does not allow me to set up a separate work space.  I also have a teenage son at home who I have to be mindful of in terms of confidentiality, particularly in regards to safeguarding.  I do not want him feeling pushed out of his home because I am now expected to work from home.  I appreciate it is a difficult time but the emotional and mental wellbeing of staff is as important as our physical health and at this time more than ever we are relying on each other at work in the office.  "</em></li><li><em>"I have adequate materials, supplies and equipment to do my work - during quarter 1 I have been working from home, although DUO access has been given and I have full access to the systems to do my role from home it has been difficult without the appropriate office equipment i.e computer chair, desk. 

Training - I have not been able to undertake training via webex with an external organisation to help with using a system within the organisation, there has been a time delay when having training on webex. "</em></li><li><em>"I enjoy working for the trust and on the whole feel valued and supported. I particularly value the service I work in and feel that staff are committed and supportive of one another. However, there are a number of areas in which I feel things could be managed better.

Generally speaking, it feels as though the trust is slow to respond to change. For example, in relation to the covid pandemic I feel that changes have been slow and, particularly earlier on (when infection rates were higher), we were literally told to carry on with 'business as usual', with little regard for welfare of staff whilst the rest of the country had largely closed down. Face-to-face meetings and huddles continued without any form of social distancing where this was completely unnecessary. I was allowed to work from home but only after weeks of stating my case for doing so (I have asthma and can do all necessary aspects of my role remotely). Risk assessments were not completed proactively with staff. 
I have never worked in a trust before where the IT systems block so many websites - this feels very much like a nanny state. In my role I require access to journal articles, many of which I have been unable to access. I would also benefit from YouTube videos to share with patients, however these too are blocked. Our department is lacking in IT equipment and at times I have had no choice but to use my own equipment. As a department, we have been waiting for well over 6 months to access to iPads to deliver clinical assessment tools which are used widely in other services - we have been repeatedly asked for the same information without any resolution. Barriers to delivering services like this can be extremely frustrating. In many ways, it feels like the trust do not welcome change but look for reasons to prevent it. It would be great if the trust could develop a more forward thinking and progressive attitude to patient care, where change was seen as something to strive for, rather than fear."</em></li><li><em>"Over the last 11 weeks as a team we have felt like we have been left to our own devices to maintain the outbreak in which the farnworth areas been the biggest hit with covid 19 fatalities. I Feel that the equipment we received was not adequate to look after these patients and maintain safety. Nearly all the team was not fit tested for appropriate masks, and also at to rely on donations from schools at one point for equipment. Now track and trace coming in, higher management are worried now re are safety and keeping the 2 meter distance and putting rules in place due to increase of staff going off. Farnworth DNS don’t have eating or toileting facilities at weekend and have to travel miles to use toilet facilities now that you can’t use supermarkets. We have to use pikes lane health centre which is invading team bubbles to use cooking and toilet facilities and also safety huddles which is not ideal on returns when you got travel back to farnworth to complete visits. I also feel that uniforms need to be looked at through the year especially over the pandemic its shown that current uniform are not appropriate when using full PPE.
"</em></li><li><em>"Since the start of the Covid situation, we have been working in a very unclean environment.  We were told that domestic services in office areas had been cut right down to the point where the toilet was absolutely filthy not having been cleaned for quite a few days at a time, some days there was no soap or tissues to wipe hands.  THIS WAS WHEN WE WERE REPEATEDLY BEING TOLD TO WASH OUR HANDS REGULARLY!  The situation was brought to the attention of our Manager who did not seem to be able to sort anything.  This was to a point where I did not want to come to work as I knew how filthy the surroundings were.  "</em></li></ul><br/>.  Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Most of the time my ward is short of staff but despite this, I still ensure patients receive the highest quality of care and I do my job effectively.

The answer that the band 7's are given is that there are empty beds on the unit so we cant close. But surely if it is extremely busy, becoming dangerous and midwives are burnt out and not getting breaks we should be able to close.  Band 7's have been given their role to run the unit and they should be trusted in their judgement that the unit is too busy and is becoming unsafe.  Not being able to close because we have an empty bed is very disheartening and it shouldn't matter how much it costs to close the unit lives are more important (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I am happy for positive changes however feel that sudden rotation list are unnecessary and cause a lot of upset.

I don't have access to the correct assessments that I need, those I do have are in storage and are significantly out of date.  I no longer have an office, which for a few weeks has been manageable but have had to resort to doing my telephone clinic in my car due to lack of room availability.  The clinic rooms which we know use have no access to Microsoft word - I can't dictate my clinic letters so I have to type them as an email and send them to my secretary.  The web version of outlook is clunky.  I cannot access LE2.

Not able to join in with multiagency meetings via Microsoft teams/ webex / zoom etc from work due to wifi and hardware issues.
This is severely compromising our ability to work effectively in the restrictions and also reduces job satisfaction.
Not enough rooms to do remote telephone clinics as all staff needing them so often doing these in shared rooms which is very distracting."</em></li></ul></span>

Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Despite being enthusiastic , positive , proactive and hardworking - I am not supported in my career progression .It is hard to see when some staff are supported and progress in their career with less experience, than yourself. Still have a smile in my face and do what is required to get the best outcome for the patients and the service."</em></li><li><em>"A lack of training is making me feel disillusioned. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I have tried for several years now to obtain some funding to complete the plaster course,  as I work in the plaster room & the plaster course is really an essential requisite to keep plastering knowledge & teaching up to date. However I have not been able to secure any funding from this trust. Other trusts both locally & nationally do support their staff in plaster room & provide funding for this. "</em></li><li><em>"I can continue to work for very long periods of time but I cannot always physically give my best so I disagree with this comment. 
I feel happy when at work (most of the time) however being immersed in work particularly in maternity isn't always a good thing we need time to reflect and learn in this role and there aren't enough opportunities for this, especially not as a team. Its on to the next one which means often you are not learning and making positive changes to your work. "</em></li><li><em>"training sessions regularly would help new members of staff to gaining more confidence within their role"</em></li><li><em>"I have always found the trust to be supportive and have  provided opportunities for me to develop in my role"</em></li><li><em>"Although I am not unhappy in my role or with the trust, I find the lack of opportunity for AHPs beyond band 7 extrememly frustrating. There is a clear pathway for nurses while there is comparatively little for AHPs, particularly in the hospital. I feel that in order to progress I will have to leave the trust and I find that very frustrating."</em></li><li><em>"I qualified as a Nursing associate nearly 2 years ago, I asked to be seconded but got told that the trust don't second staff any more, yet a lot of nurses have and are being seconded to do the ANP course, why cant I go for my band 5 and be seconded. I have got a pin number and done my IV course and medicines management course. I have done my preceptor ship and was about to do a acute medicines management course till covid 19 came along. I am dedicated and eager to progress yet this trust doesn't provide. I always got told that you can progress at Royal Bolton, but I feel as though I have been let down, really disappointed, much to the fact that I have applied to work at another trust "</em></li><li><em>"At times it can be overwhelming, taking on specialised roles can lead to lack of support or expectations that you will do things. Supporting an MDT approach to patient care works well and allows for junior staff members to gain the knowledge and clinical skills to support. 
The role of the Nurse is ever changing and Bolton has supported me in achieving the career goals I set out many years ago. I feel supported by the wider trust community and my role is valued by others outside my team. "</em></li><li><em>"I started a fixed term contract in December 2019. Due to Covid 19 I don't feel I have really seen the job as it should be and also not been able to do any additional training. I have still learned so much and love being back in a hospital setting. All working together and remembering we are all here for the same reason. Maybe the above answers would be different if we had not had Covid-19?"</em></li><li><em>"I am looking forward to developing my career at Bolton and I believe there will be ample opportunities to do so within this organisation. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"There are opportunities to further develop the role of AHP's and I feel that this should be explored more within the division. Opportunities for cross divisional learning would be useful. A historical lack of funding for external courses seems inequitable across divisions- staff having to take leave to attend self-funded courses/no budget for funded courses- this can have an impact of staff moral (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"A continual lack of development opportunities in theatre. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Please can you offer some nursing opportunities for some HCAs who are willing to progress. "</em></li><li><em>"I love my job, but it feels as if there is no progression in my role. Secondments posts are very few and through my observation there are no minority staff in managerial positions that begs the question of why is that."</em></li><li><em>"My job role has not been fulfilled to its full potential. I feel I have lost necessary skills which other people of the same job title have. I also feel there is little progression  "</em></li><li><em>"I have recently become a team member of ChatHealth which gives a new dimension to my role."</em></li><li><em>"I have always found the trust to be supportive and have  provided opportunities for me to develop in my role"</em></li><li><em>"SAS doctors should get more opportunities for their development."</em></li><li><em>"Ward Clerks at band 2 should be given the opportunity to take on further training in order to progress onto a higher banding such as a band 3, which would enable them to be able to take on more responsibility within their department. This would ensure that they are achieving their full potential and have been given a chance to progress in their career, whilst improving the service of their department. 
My reason for this is because, ward clerks tend to work the same long hours as nursing staff, and are a vital role in the smooth running of wards, to admit and discharge patients, handling bed management, stock control, and many more tasks. "</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff have commented on their satisfaction with the opportunities they have to use their skills and abilities.  Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Despite lots of changes in the trust and my role I feel continually downskilled which is not good for staff morale"</em></li><li><em>"Only one thing I would like to mention is that I would like to move to band 6 and complete my health visiting as there are high number of Asian community in this area and only few Asian Health Visitor. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I feel that giving more of my service opportunities is difficult for me here. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Now is the time to look at diversifying the workforce across specialities, as it has been proven during the COVID situation that some staff groups have thrived during redeployment.  The trust should seriously consider opening up certain roles in specific areas, especially across critical care, to other staff groups who have positively embraced and changed the way they practice for the benefit of our sickest patients.  Diversity will make us more attractive as an employer, will breed the desire to professionally achieve, and progress practice for the good of our patients as well as our colleagues."</em></li></ul><br/>Other comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"feel well supported and I have been given opportunity to develop."</em></li></ul></span>

Why do people get overtime on a band 2 job when they are on a higher band E.g. Band 5,6?? They earn enough. This stops band 2's from getting any. 
"</em></li><li><em>"I am concerned about the impact of continuity of care may have on the workforce - the expectations may be too high / unrealistic feel its a two tier system for Band 7's in the unit - some roles more valued than others - leading to unfair opportunity prospects, feelings of devalued staff."</em></li><li><em>"We have had no manager over the hcas for a very long time, the hcas work well together and have supported each other. We have had to sort problems out above our banding and the whole structure of the unit has not run how it should have been run. Some team members have been stepping up there roles and supporting the team, we really appreciated their help, they had put a plan into management to support and look after us. To our great disappointment higher management have informed these team members to back off from us. We will continue to support each other. "</em></li><li><em>"MY ROLE WITHIN THE TRUST HAS BEEN CHANGED AND MY POSITION HAS BEEN DOWN GRADED. HOWEVER, I STILL DO NOT HAVE A REVISED JOB DESCRIPTION AND AS THERE IS NO-ONE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO CARRY OUT THE DUTIES I PREVIOUSLY UNDERTOOK AT THE HIGHER BAND. I AM CONTINUING WITH THIS ASPECT OF MY ROLE BUT WITHOUT GUIDANCE; I FEEL THIS IS BOTH UNFAIR AND UNSAFE"</em></li><li><em>"I do not think it is fair that in other departments staff are being re-banded at a higher grade and our role isn't even being looked at. We have fought to be re-banded (To be inline with the rest of the trusts in the CCN) for the last 2 years and been knocked back every time, but someone from a neighbouring department shouts louder and gets re-banded within a month, we are amalgamating with HDU which requires the educators to take on all their staff. Our band 7 educator is not paid by the trust they are funded by the critical care network this is not a fair and equal process and will be the reason staff go to other trusts to be paid correctly for the role they are actually doing. I have never felt so under appreciated from this trust. (Not my immediate managers as they support me 100%). "</em></li><li><em>"I feel that staff that go above and beyond are often not recognised.  I feel the Trust is unfair in it's approach to the pay band and decisions on when to re-band a staff member."</em></li><li><em>"I have been working for the Trust for the past 13 years and a lot has changed in that time. I feel that certain colleagues have "their own agenda" and do not recognise the attributes, skills and knowledge I possess. I have been on courses to enable me to enhance my career and help the department, e.g. cannulation and AIM's, but after successfully passing the course, the rug has been pulled from under my feet stating that I can perform the duties I have been trained to do. Staff have asked me for advice in the past or for me to share my knowledge, to be told in the next breath that "it is not your place to pass the info on" or "train" the person asking me; this leaves me very annoyed and exasperated."</em></li><li><em>"Do feel that recruitment of senior roles is not don't fairly.  No adverts or interviews to appoint senior people to roles"</em></li><li><em>"For a long time, even pre BoltonFT I have felt like I have worked above and beyond my job description. This didn't use to bother me as I believed it was good for my personal development and was supporting my Matron. Since the tender I have been becoming increasingly frustrated. I still feel disappointed that Nurses with the level of experience they had were expected to apply and interview for their own jobs. I feel frustrated with the fact that very experienced Nurses were not given the opportunity to express interests for positions that some of us are more than qualified and experienced to do. More recently I have become annoyed with the level of responsibility I have and the tasks I complete especially now we have 2 band 7 (1WTE) in the service and a band 8. I find it frustrating that the band 7 is only supporting, in my eyes, 50% of the team and I, as well as the other band 6's are completing a band 7 role with no pay recognition or scope for promotion. If anything since joining the FT we have been taking on more responsibility despite having a more tiered management structure. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Black and ethnic minority people are being made to either accept the risk of dying from covid or work in green areas. In my case this will average a monthly shortfall of around £500 once losses from out of hours and on call have been considered. Therefore in my case I will eventually be forced to take this risk in order to keep my home and feed my family. I am CERTAIN that the trust and our managers will not face this problem and therefore it will not be in their list of priorities. However this is real issue to people like myself on the ground who before these risk assessments were in the daily fight against this disease. "</em></li><li><em>"Community services are not recognised as frequently as hospital services.  We work flexibly and with complex caseloads to achieve the best care we can.
For many years there has been no funding for external training to further our service provision and knowledge and development. "</em></li><li><em>"I hope we do see positive changes now. I hope its a happy ad healthy place to work and we rise above the challenges we face. I hope one day,  I wont even realise that I am BAME. "</em></li><li><em>"I am completely in the dark, for example I worked 36 hours over last bank holiday, some of the time I was the only member of staff in our area, I saw one patient and traveled two miles, meanwhile my wife sat at home on her own.  What is the point.... 
also my team has been taken over by a lead that has stopped me doing the roll which I have successfully undertaken for six years without adequate explanation, I have asked why but have been fobbed off.  I have worked for three trusts over the 26 years NHS service and this is by far the poorest one for the way the staff are treated. "</em></li><li><em>"Discretionary Effort 
I would like to see tougher measures regarding Trust sickness policies and our Occupational Health service. 
Rewards such as additional annual leave days for those who rarely take time off with sickness might be an incentive for colleagues to stay in work. 
Due to sickness the workload seems to be apportioned to one smaller group of considerate/reliable staff members. This builds resentment in the team putting the focus on those off sick rather than those that can be relied upon."</em></li><li><em>"This trust has a lot of work to do, people will say they are happy but in all fairness they are not. I have a great team but can sometimes feels unfair, love my manager she is fair but looking for the whole trust things for staff are poor"</em></li><li><em>"It was verbally discussed in August 2019 that I would be stepping up a band as the work I had shown and additional responsibilities I had taken was beneficial to the team,  this talk occurred at the same time as another colleague. They received a step up in band a few months after. However, I am still waiting this agreed band increase and have been told recently that there is no additional money. I don't feel a valued member of the team and that my additional work is just being taken for granted. My additional manager has been very supportive in trying to secure this without any luck. I love my job but do feel undervalued by the trust. "</em></li><li><em>"Wish our job will be a grade 3, all other trusties doing same job are a three.  
This can affect a lot of areas, people should be given equal opportunities to learn other functions.
One should not feel out of place and different from others."</em></li><li><em>"I feel there should be more openness and transparency, things don't always seem fair for different groups of staff.

But for some reason only medical end got it and one person in surgical end, which has made a lot of staff very upset. we spoke to ward managers who stated they did not know anything, then mentioned to matron, who said we have got a pot of money but that was where it was left. We were asked to send all proof in which I did of everything I do and cert etc.. and my old ward manager signed a yellow confirmation letter to sign off that we do these jobs on the ward, which was all sent in, passed onto our union this was 18 months ago now we are still no further on, still doing the jobs because I don't want to de skill myself now, and it relieves pressure from our nurses, as we are a very busy ward..

I don't have faith that writing this is going to help, but as this opportunity's arisen with the survey I thought I might have one last shot.

I was then apprehended on a corridor by a matron (not even a confidential area) and told that I had breached the social media policy, I then received a formal warning letter in the post, every other staff member involved wasn't even spoken too let alone got a formal letter that is on their work record, I feel this is unfair treatment when in the past I have never had any issue with my work ethic."</em></li><li><em>"I have had to raise concerns two years ago under the dignity at work policy for myself and 8 others in my department over the last two years that have resigned, some put complaints in against senior managers to the CEO and other seniors who have now left because of it after suffering bullying, harassment & threatening behaviour for quite a long time and an investigation was commissioned in 2018. The Investigating officer was great and documented and understood everything and it was such a relief to be able to tell somebody alongside HR & my Union Rep at that time. The senior manager that dealt with this thoroughly and professionally at the time but one year later from the outcome in 2019 it seems to have now been pointless and forgotten about and the management that caused the issues were separated and one manager was moved out of the department and redeployed and put on training but has somehow found their way back in to the very office it all began in with the other manager everyday instead of working from their office which is on a ward which leaves us going full circle and back to square one again probably fighting the same cause in the future with Managers you simply can not trust, feel comfortable with or respect when what you have said in an investigation is confirmed and has been dealt with and what you asked for in the outcome to avoid this happening again does not apply anymore after one year,  these managers did not change or behave any differently afterwards but it was not directed at me anymore but others. I see encouragement on the intranet to get staff to speak freely or to speak to a freedom to speak guardian to tackle these problems which I did but from my soul destroying experience which caused me lots of stress & anxiety to stand up and do the right thing to get what I did to get the initial outcome so it doesn't happen to anyone else now seems like it just was not worth it and pointless and we now are back to square one with poor management, no support and ridiculous decisions on things they have no knowledge or experience on and how you to do your job to the best of your ability to be proud of where you work.  I have many years NHS service here at Bolton & many years NHS service with GP's in the community prior to working at this Hospital and with a very heavy heart I have to say that my pride, faith, loyalty and respect for all of it has been chipped away at for 5 years and has not been restored despite doing the right thing and it is still not much better due to poor management."</em></li><li><em>"This is not an inclusive environment to work in.  The same opportunities are not available for all and individual needs are not considered.  i don't feel valued and feel anxious in the workplace.  i don't feel able to approach management about any concerns as they are not professionally dealt with and you are then seen to be a troublemaker, which then affects how you develop within the department.  Staff are not engaged fairly when disagreements or issues arise and are often tackled in the open office for all colleagues and peers to witness. There is no set training as a clinician would get, therefore others receive more exposure to learning based on what seems to be who is liked more.  Everyone should receive the same opportunity to learn as everyone learns in different ways and have different backgrounds and commitments at home.  There is no work life balance and it appears you are only promoted if you sacrifice your family time or time outside of work, which leads me to believe that your success is measured by not what you do when you are in work but how much time is spent here."</em></li><li><em>"Unfortunately, I have not felt supported at all recently during COVID. On the first day of track and trace, my son was sent home from school having had contact with another child in his key worker bubble who had tested positive for COVID. I was advised to get him tested and if negative he should return to school and me to work which was against government legislation, NHS guidance and the algorithm on our own intranet. I questioned this and was told by HR that I had misunderstood track and trace and if the test came back negative, it meant negative and that the trust were testing people without symptoms anyway. On trying to explain the discrepancies in this and that my son had no symptoms and therefore should isolate for the 14 days I was asked if I was refusing the test. My manager also spoke with HR who said they would clarify things. 
I took my 5 year old child for the test which obviously isn't pleasant. When I phoned the trust with the negative result and informed them that he was unable to return to school due the need to isolate for the 14 day period. I was told that he would indeed need to isolate for the 14 days but that as I was not required to isolate, it was essentially a child care issue so would be expected to return to work or use annual leave/carers leave/unpaid leave. As I can not leave him unattended, my options are limited. 
I understand on one hand that yes this is a childcare issue but as a single parent with a formal childcare arrangement in place, a refusal for any additional support during this crisis from the father and the inability to use childcare or place my child in anybody else care at this time, I did not have any option than to isolate with him. 
The reason my child was placed in school was to allow me to continue working for the trust, supporting the NHS and continuing to give care to patients. I have in essence risked my life and that of my children to continue doing so. On this occasion, I have managed to cover the time with carers leave, time owing and additional weekend working. My 3 children are now based at 3 different schools in 3 different bubbles, all still amongst other "key worker" children.  There does not seem to be any contingency for if/when this situation occurs again apart from using my annual leave and ultimately taking unpaid leave. 
I find it particularly difficult to understand how my situation differs from that of people in the trust who have been paid in full to shield their children over the initial 3 month period. I did not have a choice in any of these decisions and whilst other cases were assessed individually, I feel that I have been let down and punished by the trust for following all said guidelines.  To reiterate as a single parent my only choice ultimately will be to pay the bills and break government legislation and NHS guidance. "</em></li><li><em>"I don't feel like as a team we have been listened to during the Corona pandemic.  We have been in every day unless we have booked leave.  We were unable to be set up to work from home and haven't been able to work on a rota between our team so that this would give us time some time off (with children etc).  There have been days when there hasn't been much to do.  Things are improving now as we are helping with other things in the department.  It's been difficult when the safest place for us to be would be at home.

I struggle to find a work-life balance here sometimes.

I had to have some time off sick due to anxiety and have tried to get help with this.  I've seen the GP and am taking medication.  I've done an online CBT course, and have had some counselling sessions in my own time on my day off.  I have been offered a course of face to face CBT via video link at the moment and need a couple of hours each week to attend but I'm told I don't get time for these sorts of appointments and have had to book annual leave.  I don't mind but it uses a lot of my leave up and it makes things more difficult when trying to plan leave around my children with nursery/school holidays and the current Corona situation.  

 Some of the policies don't seem fair as a lot say "manager's discretion" so some people would be able to have time off for an issue perhaps but then some wouldn't.  Policies should perhaps be clearer so it's the same across the board.

It's nice that the Trust offers the wellbeing courses run by Boo.  I attended a few before the Corona virus outbreak and I really seemed to get a lot from them.  They were very helpful."</em></li><li><em>"It would have been better if permanent staff has been given financial rewards especially during the covid outbreak. We were never informed about having no enhancements during our bank shifts and ONLY half of the time we worked will be paid overtime. It was even on BOB that we would receive overtime rates. And now, payroll is saying another thing. I feel that this is not fair for all the staff who worked so hard, were redeployed, and been extending their help to the trust in times of need. If we have the funds to pay the agency staff, why can't we take care of our own staff? We had no problem when the management called for help. Please also consider having the NHS-P for the bank staff. They give out higher rates that will entice permanent staff to do more bank shifts.  "</em></li><li><em>"I hold a level 3 diploma and still only a band 2 its so disappointing my manager says I should have a 3 but its the matrons saving money"</em></li><li><em>"I feel very dissatisfied at present because people who are shielding are being rewarded for not coming to work. I appreciate that they have to shield but myself and my colleagues who have continued to come into work, even after contracting the virus are having to cover and don't get treated the same.
We have people who are deliberately off sick for no reason. It's just not fair.

I am aware of other companies who have rewarded their staff with bonuses etc and we get the cast offs of left over stock."</em></li><li><em>"Also we feel that the staff who have been shielding have had better recognition than the staff who have continued to come to work risking getting the virus and passing it on to family at home.  "</em></li><li><em>"I feel that due to the current/ongoing coronavirus situation the  "Goodwill & flexibility" of the staff have been grossly taken advantage of."</em></li><li><em>"Workforce/payroll mess up pretty bad during this pandemic in terms of the bank shift. They did not clearly communicate their policy and scrap off the enhancement to regular staff. I was on a covid ward and often asked to do some bank shift to help my department, but was surprised regarding their policy of removing enhancement to staff but was giving enhance rate to agency nurse. it is just disappointing to us regular staff to feel under value during those times."</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff do not feel fairly treated by their manager.  Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Management of staff poor performance in a team/teams, particularly long term/repeat "offenders" of poor working behaviour, is not up to a standard I have seen in other Trusts (Salford).

For example during recent times when the weather has been extremely hot and we are not allowed to go into a shop to get a cold drink or to get a sandwich for our lunch when other working people are. We work out all day and do not have access to a kitchen all day like ward staff.
Also when members of the public are calling us disease spreaders it is not nice and no one stands up for us. We are probably the cleanest people as we wash our hands up to 30 times a day, wear full ppe per patient etc. No one speaks out for us higher up. "</em></li><li><em>"I love my job and my team but we do not feel supported by management.  Our department has been given a "bad rep" by a previous managers.  We are being judged because of previous members of staff who have left the Trust, which is completely unfair.  We are never involved in discussions with management regarding changes within the office and how they think the office would run more smoothly/efficiently.  "</em></li><li><em>" Treated unfairly"</em></li><li><em>"I am unhappy that we are being exposed to other people's political views. I am very sad what is happening in the world and recent world events. I despise racism and cannot stand things that are not fair. However, because of all the media and social media reporting and now our CEO email, I feel I should be ashamed to be white and hold my head in shame. I feel that my opportunities and needs as a white person are being completely overlooked. I am not allowed to say what I see or what I feel, for fear of being accused of being a racist. I feel I am not allowed an opinion. Our freedom of speech, which our forefathers fought wars for us to have, is no longer allowed as any opinion is deemed as racist. Everyone in this Trust should be given equal opportunities, not any one particular group. We all matter but sadly that is not what I am seeing right now."</em></li><li><em>"At my work  there are many clicks and now they have become so big that hinders the work and progress. As hidden culture of who you know does not help to progress if you are not in the right mix of people."</em></li><li><em>"No consultation with team to ascertain their views on proposals for recent restructure. Advert for new role issued without telling team. Advert states "We are absolutely committed to your personal development and will ensure you have a developmental plan which supports you to be the best person you can be in this role" - where is this level of support for existing team members?  I was committed to this role and the organisation but feel very let down by recent events.  Have appreciated home working during the pandemic.

Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Recently I have been appalled at the treatment of a member of staff being rotated to an area of work which previously caused her to have PTSD ! There has been no duty of care provided for her what so ever and as a result she is suffering with anxiety. Management should be taking personal issues into account before rotating staff to other areas of work without consultation with that staff member! Bolton is not renowned for looking after their staff and this is just one example."</em></li><li><em>"I appreciate that over the last 3 months things have been very difficult for everyone in the NHS due to the pandemic but I feel that particularly in the area I work there has been what feels like unnecessary changes to push forward plans for a new service. I appreciate that things need to change but in these very uncertain and difficult times these additional changes have adversely affected my health and well being."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that the management regularly change around staff to different departments without any notice or consideration for the member of staff. This causes a lot of upset, and in some cases is very detrimental to their mental health. The knock on effect is that it causes staff to feel insecure at work and a high staff turn over. I appreciate the role is rotational - but its my opinion that happy staff will always go above and beyond in the work place. Rotation of staff could be handled more sensitively. "</em></li><li><em>"The thing that really helped me through this time was having some familiar faces, from my own team, who were redeployed with me. This meant that I had people who knew me, who I felt comfortable talking to and who were having similar experiences to me. Without this, I really feel that I would not have been able to complete my redeployment and maintain good mental health.  If there was to ever be redeployment on a large scale again, whether a second Covid-19 wave or for another reason, I urge the trust to listen to the experiences of the people who have been redeployed and learn from these varied experiences. 

For me, what I would suggest for the future would be to have a more planned approach to the redeployment, with more notice if this is able to happen. I would also suggest maybe a staggered approach, as we found a surplus staff at times when the situation wasn't as desperate as originally expected. Staggering how many people you would redeploy into a situation would minimise this and make sure people were supporting in the correct and productive ways. I would also say, if possible, to have people redeployed with someone who they know is really helpful for support and wellbeing. Finally, having structure, support, training and clarity to ensure that staff feel confident and competent in the work that they will be doing, I think is invaluable in providing an overall better and more seamless redeployment experience for staff and help to provide the best patient care possible. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand from my perspective, as I have taken the time to write this down for you. 
"</em></li><li><em>"My experience of redeployment has not been the most positive experience. I will discuss the positives I have taken from the experience but I do feel that it is important to highlight and share my experience, to make the trust aware of the individual experiences behind the redeployment initiative. I am only speaking for myself and I urge the trust to reach out to every redeployed person for feedback, as I think you would have a range of experiences to learn from."</em></li><li><em>"I enjoy my job but until my Line Manager came into post I felt I was constantly trying to fight for and justify my role, this resulted in significant burn out (I was off work for 6 months).
I am hard working and will often work beyond my contracted hours which I feel able to cope with. I became extremely concerned and stressed when asked to take on other roles and work in what I felt was a very unsafe way so the Trust could say they were offering women 'choice'
The Line Manager of my team is fantastic and I now feel supported and able to provide the best care I can to the families I care for. I am very happy in my job but feel if this Line Manager was to leave I would become very concerned
I am very aware that many of the midwives within community and working within the maternity unit are feeling under a lot of pressure with many leaving and many looking to work else where. I feel this is due to constant change, constant pressure and staff being under valued and not listened to. The introduction of Continuity of Carer and the model the Head of Midwifery has adopted has impacted in a very negative way. I have observed fragmentation of care + staff being overwhelmed with what is being asked of them. I do not think staff concerns are being listened to and a previously happy maternity unit is in danger of loosing a large number of experienced midwives.
"</em></li><li><em>"The IMC@Home community team has totally been dismantled, relocated and changed due to Covid 19 which is totally understandable but staff strongly feel that once Covid 19 is under control the team should be able to return back to it's original base and structure before any long term service changes are proposed.  Staff strongly feel Covid 19 has been used to justify major service changes (including weekend working) without adequate consultation and the changes will continue beyond Covid 19 without staff consultation or engagement. "</em></li><li><em>"To put the answers about management into context, this is just as we are at the moment, until very recently we benefited from an excellent, caring manager and my answers would all have been positive. Now our team structure has changed completely and we, as a team, do not feel listened to or respected and many people are angry and upset. Communication about changes has been extremely poor at best and mainly dictated rather than discussed before implementation. Despite the current problems I am confident that some of the new ways of working will be beneficial and this does not stop me being extremely proud of my role and to work for the Trust."</em></li><li><em>"My direct team leader has provided support but support across the inpatient therapies from managers has been very minimal during Covid crisis when we needed it the most. Many changes are coming but we don't feel included in these changes & that leaves staff feeling very demoralised after years of hard work. "</em></li><li><em>"We don’t feel as involved as we previously did so in shaping the future of our service.

We often get made aware of changes via email and whilst I think my immediate manager cares about the team, I do not feel the more senior managers do and feel neglected by them. I currently feel very unhappy in my job. "</em></li><li><em>"Difficult to give answers as I am not in the job I loved due to redeployment, where I had no structure or manager - was passed from place to place where staff thought I was bank staff and have received rumours that I had no job to go back to once redeployment. After weeks of rumours had meeting to confirm no INT job to return to - had a brilliant team and can now see patients coming to AAT in crisis as no proactive input being given. Worked hard to achieve the qualifications needed to carry out my job, and now have no motivation, feel we have been poorly communicated with and years of hard work unappreciated. Not listened to staff /patient feedback.  "</em></li><li><em>"It has been particularly difficult at this time with covid with the unknown but it would of helped if managers had discussed changes with the team first rather than being told what to do without discussion on how this would affect the team specifically or how we feel about it. If they had been more responsive to making the team safe from the start rather than only enforcing measures when told by higher management. 
Suggestions from staff that are in line with government standards of work from home where possible are still being ignored as staff have to always been seen to be doing something even if very little to do in the office also. 
staff morale is very low at present and this just seems to be ignored or not bothered about. "</em></li><li><em>"I feel our service is developing new ways of working but management do not ask people with years of knowledge and experience for their opinions, especially when they are later asked to become involved or the work stream being developed directly involves them.
There is a feeling of things being "done to us" rather than empowering staff and it can create apathy, with the leadership style of some senior management."</em></li><li><em>"I often feel frustrated when decisions and changes are made and implemented without consultation or understanding of the impact the change will have on the role/team. I feel that morale is very low at present and colleagues appear apathetic and demoralised. I have heard staff report that they do not feel able to question or challenge management regarding decisions made that directly affect their role/team. They feel brow beaten and now simply agree, even if they feel negatively about proposals and/or decisions."</em></li><li><em>"During the pandemic I have found the new ways of communicating, decision making by management and constant change has created more stress within the work environment, many decisions about the team were made without prior discussion and although I understand the reasons for this and the need for ways of working to change rapidly it has created extra stress dealing with the fall out from team members and at times created a negative working environment. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Due to the current health climate I feel we have not been fully supported and listened to within the working environment.  Although I have spoken to managers about low team morale this has been ignored and areas of concern have not been recognised."</em></li><li><em>"Thank you for the feedback opportunity.  To contextualise some of my responses, I would highlight the statement that asked:  "I feel I understand the connection between my role and the wider vision of the Trust."  I am not confident that I do.  I am confident that I know the benefit of the work my service provides for the Bolton family.  I do wonder at Trust level if there is adequate communication of the social determinants of health - thus, I would invert the statement and respectfully ask, does the Trust understand the connection between its vision and the roles of respective services and their staff?  I don't mean to be unfair asking this and I do feel some further immersion on Trust issues would give me a greater understanding.  Some issues related perhaps are the fact that I cannot easily access the intranet from varied sites in community venues.  On a different issue, I do not understand why as part of reducing carbon footprint the Trust do not incentivise users of bicycles, say by enabling expenses to be claimed.  Also negotiating discounts or making partnerships with gyms to help the workforce stay physically and mentally well.  Thank you."</em></li><li><em>"Some of my answers may not be as expected. I am due to retire next month and reflect in some of my answers.
I have valued the time I have spent here in Bolton. I have always been supported by my line managers, and the majority of senior managers. One of the biggest changes I have seen which I don't feel has improves services, is the way the then ward sisters were given less responsibility for their ward and roles taken away from them, with higher management telling them how to run their ward. While I am happy to support and promote change, this was not one of those."</em></li><li><em>"The trust, and my department, is generally a good place to work. However, the covid crisis has revealed acute failings - there was a leadership vacuum at the start of covid and no transparency around the Trust's early plans. While I appreciate that a) the situation was ever-changing and b) there is little point panicking grassroots staff unnecessarily early, as a band 8 nurse specialist it was disappointing that even as senior clinicians we weren't informed of plans. 
The problem of bureaucracy is an ever-present NHS problem and I appreciate that it is not unique to Bolton. It would be really refreshing to look at knee-jerk paperwork as an approach to problem-solving and see if this is really effective."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that management are not always taking staffs opinions into consideration and we are sometimes treated as machines working 12 hours without a break. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Management do not discuss reason behind changes we are often just given instructions about changes, not the rational behind them. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Think its been a very challenging time for everyone but don't think your worries had been addressed before moving you around and still not been ."</em></li><li><em>"I have always been passionate and enthusiastic about my job. However, i am afraid to say that decisions are being made without consultation of staff. I hear rumours of further changes being that may be made by management that would make out jobs out in the community even harder. I understand things have needed to be changed at pace due to COVID19. However it has never been explained to us why moving into hubs has been decided. I know this is the NHS and things change. However it is a crying shame that some teams have been split up and then watered down, then placed out in a hub. The team i worked with previously was dynamic, reactive and worked together to achieve maximum outcomes for our patients in Bolton. My job now feels more mundane / general. Whilst i am making the best of my current situation (as i work with a lovely team), i am not enjoying my job as much and feel that management priority is about figures on a spreadsheet vs outcomes for patients. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate we all have a job to do, but people making management decisions about further service provision should have an understanding of what actually goes on at ground level. The only person that has really shown any interest and support is a manager, who was lovely when she came to visit us.. It is such a shame. The NHS is fantastic. It should be moving forwards in a strong, dynamic fashion. Instead I feel that things are going backwards rather than forwards......"</em></li></ul><br/>Other comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"Some of the answers given reflect my disillusionment within one arm/speciality in my area of work.

                        <span id="rptEnablers_lblEnablersFooter_7">It will be important to focus on the amount of exposure and interaction senior managers have with
staff, in order to provide staff with ample opportunity to express their views. The Trust also needs to
focus efforts on communicating actions that have taken place as a result of listening to staff. As an
enabler of staff engagement, Influence is a strong predictor of Adaptability i.e. it has a significant
impact on helping staff respond quickly and effectively to changes.</span>

Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"My direct line manager if fine and does a good job, although I do not get clear feedback. I feel that some senior management do not give feedback back in a positive way and leave me out of meetings and discussions, which sometimes leaves me unsure what are exactly my responsibilities and I do not feel valued by them. I feel that a lot of this is because I do not work full time and am therefore not valued and marginalised."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that managers need to recognise how much staff do that goes beyond what we are asked to do (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Infection Control noticeable by absence during pandemic.
Sometimes feel we don't exist as a department as very senior management did not appear aware that we deal with patients from their own home therefore we don't know their infection status i.e  staff reprimanded for wearing masks at the start of the pandemic (patient subsequently died of covid)"</em></li></ul><br/>Some staff have commented on the degree to which they feel valued and recognised by the organisation.  Comments include:<br/><ul><li><em>"I have loved working for the trust and have really enjoyed my job role. Lately I do not feel that physiotherapy have been treated well. I appreciate N Block was required for pandemic circumstances but the manner in which we were removed and how we have been treated has been awful and hurtful. I feel my immediate managers have done a great job but higher management have just disregarded our service. I feel less valued as part of the trust and feel we are not in the trust future planning/investment. Again, I appreciate the current pandemic issues are trust wide but I feel we have been particularly hard hit."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that I have not had any support during the covid period, the staff who have worked through it have been just left to get on with it. we are all exhausted physically and mentally
and I feel like there will be a massive knock on effect soon from this. we have had the occasional "youre doing a great job" but it feels like its just "lip service""</em></li><li><em>"During the COVID19 pandemic apart from thank you emails, I don't feel the staff have been acknowledged for the amount of hard work and extra hours that have been given by all employees. The very kind sentiment of sending a letter and chocolates for staff shielding was a lovely gesture and appreciate it was around their mental health as shielding is not a great situation to be in but feel that staff who attended work also may have mental health concerns/issues (not just shielding staff) and feel have been a little overlooked.  The area I work in has been so busy like many other departments/areas during the pandemic and still is, if not getting busier as lockdown relaxes more and more. It's just the 'little' things sometimes that go a long way!"</em></li><li><em>"Whilst I enjoy my job very much,  more often than not, basic ward nurses seem to be treated as less important than others who wear 'specialist' uniforms.
"</em></li><li><em>"I often feel unappreciated as I work permanent nights, on a few occasions there is a prominent days / nights divide.  One certain occasion was Nurses Day 2020 the ward manager totally disregarded night staff as we were leaving in the morning and made gifts for day staff who were working that day. This really upset me as I felt the efforts we do on the night shift do not get noticed when I know we all work extremely hard and work as a team there fore deserve recognition."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that I put 100%+ in to my role and sometimes feel taken for granted when awards and recognition are given to other colleagues for everyday things I do as normal."</em></li><li><em>"During COVID, I feel the Trust could show more recognition to all staff who have come into work, having put themselves to the risk of infection."</em></li><li><em>" I feel community is completely overlooked within the maternity directorate. Whenever there is recognition celebrating achievements within our division there are never community staff mentioned/featured. There is support for ward based staff but nil for community, besides our line managers."</em></li><li><em>"We are out of sight, and quite often miss out on a lot of what is happening in the trust, the department/ team are never awarded with anything no matter how hard we all work. The Facebook page for AACD is regularly flooded with people/ departments/ teams being nominated and winning awards or being praised for hard work and we are never mentioned. 
The staff here didn't even get praised for moving to the covid wards, or staying put and continuing to see patients I difficult time. it makes Morale very low !!, "</em></li><li><em>"Not being valued by the team."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that managers need to recognise how much staff do that goes beyond what we are asked to do- I see colleagues all the time who feel so strongly about  providing excellent care that they miss all their lunch breaks to squeeze in another school visit, phoning parents or schools with additional resources, advice or input that goes beyond what they are required to do, working at home making resources that will be more engaging, buying their own resources online to enhance therapy because there is no funding. Staff do this because they really do care so much about the children. I often feel saddened when I then hear of these same staff being refused a day off to attend a training course that they were willing to pay for themselves, or to carry over a few days annual leave during the COVID crisis. Loyalty to the trust is built on mutual respect and recognition of these staff and their efforts, regardless of band or status. I'm afraid I have been deeply disappointed by how our department has treated staff at the beginning of the covid crisis- we were given no guidance , no support, no awareness of our stress or anxiety levels. No one asked how we were feeling or if we had vulnerable people living in our homes. We were simply told to be in the office, all together, keeping busy. The trust sent us apps and advice on mental health but all we would have wanted was a manager to ask how we were and if we needed support. I had to go to my manager and say we were all very uncomfortable and anxious in our cramped office space, with no distancing in place. Only then did things change. Some colleagues have been unpaid for weeks as they had no childcare. I thoroughly enjoy my job. It is highly rewarding and engaging. I work with an excellent team and feel lucky in my role. My personal experience is good, I have flexibility and support from my line manager- but it is the wider staff group in my department that I am concerned about."</em></li><li><em>"Sometimes feel forgotten about as I just get on with it, can go for days without seeing or speaking to managers "</em></li><li><em>"The team are exhausted.  The work of the HR team has been overlooked by the trust during the COVID response yet the whole function has worked above and beyond. well being is important however not more important than the work everyone else has been doing yet it does not appear this way."</em></li><li><em>"The Trust is totally submerged in the use of social media. If you are not seen to be posting you feel as though you do not exist. The Trust is very good at appearing to the outside that it values the staff but deep down this does not happen. "</em></li><li><em>"I feel giving more support  to Outpatients unit managers would be beneficial, we are very different to ward managers within our working environments."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that the team working in special schools is an invisible nuance within the Trust. We sit between health, education and social care and it can get very complicated at times- particularly in the current climate. We are under the children's community team but should work more closely with the 5-19 service but they will not engage with us. We special schools nurses work autonomously on our own and it can be very lonely and difficult. I do not feel part of the school I am based nor fully part of the Trust as it is difficult to engage being based in a school. This can feel challenging at times and has been especially hard for moral during covid19 pressures."</em></li><li><em>"I feel under valued as a member of staff as we are rarely praised for all the hard work we do.  "</em></li><li><em>"Not valued"</em></li><li><em>"I do feel undervalued at work. I feel that feedback is often negative and it would boost morale to consistently be told what we are doing well as well as where we can improve. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I feel very let down by the NHS during the Covid-19 Pandemic.  Our office was not risk assessed to ensure 2 metres were between myself and colleagues, we were not given masks, hand gel or any cleaning products to clean our work areas.  We have been forgotten and left on our own.  As a team we have worked together and throughout the pandemic, none of us have been off with any covid symptoms.  This is through our due care and attention, not the NHS looking after its staff.
We are a large office - the hub of the NHS for booking appointments / admissions - we have received no thanks or appreciation from the senior management.  We have never been mentioned in any of the Covid bulletins for the work we have been doing.  
We ensured no patients came in to the hospital when the pandemic started, we cancelled thousands of appointments by changing them to telephone / video appointments.  We cancelled hundreds of admissions in to hospital and adapted a new way of working very quickly.  
During the peak we moved to working 5 days over 7 to help with a moments notice.  
Week 12 of lockdown we were issued with masks - this I feel was an insult.  Like all of a sudden we matter.  Personally I feel we were only issued masks because of the track and trace app going live.  Should one of us be off with symptoms, then the whole office would have to isolated - meaning there would be no-one to do the work.
I am not taking anything away from the front line staff who have been amazing and of course, getting them set up with PPE was the priority, but the clerical and admin staff in our office has heard nothing from anyone.  I feel the NHS has let down its own staff - not a great example to set to our patients.  "</em></li><li><em>"At times I feel very undervalued and unappreciated by the trust as a whole .My line manager is great but overall the trust as awhile feels as though we are not appreciated "</em></li><li><em>"No real reward for staff who never go off sick, even when over 5 years without a day off.  Same card every year."</em></li><li><em>"I feel at present that some of these points are worthy of being marked as disagree however, prior to covid most of these would've been agree. I understand that covid has been a major issues for the trust and has caused changes but I feel that these could've been handled better. We have been made to feel like a service which is not valued and this makes staff morale extremely low. We are trying to keep the positivity within the department and continue to hope for positive changes for us!"</em></li><li><em>"Sometimes I feel that as community staff we are forgotten and this was shown during the times we should of received free things for example the M&S meal we never got any of these things delivered to us, even though we have worked throughout this difficult time working in different ways to deliver care. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"We as an office are extremely disappointed that during the covid shutdown, various departments have been given awards for better Bolton etc, and our office has not even received a thankyou from above our own management, we were the first ones to deal with the impact by having to cancel every outpatient and admission apt for the whole hospital, changed our working hours and days and this is still ongoing, and yet we see others being praised for how they deal with this, no visit or personal message or acknowledgement from the Chief Exec we feel is very disappointing considering we appear to be the backbone and the first point of contact for patients in all this and in most cases the only contact for literally thousands of patients to change apts to telephone or video etc! (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"You mention rewards for staff! There is no such system for rewarding staff! This pandemic has certainly given us a different outlook on how we are treated and valued by our employer, and its very disappointing that we have not had any recognition from above at all!  And its going to be even more challenging for our team once the clinics re-open as we will be the ones bringing all the patients back in and booking every single patient in dealing with their calls and enquiries. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I find as a Band 2 that we are underestimated and all Band 2's should be promoted to Band 3, I am trying to progress myself but feel that I am always been pushed back and not encouraged by senior Management"</em></li><li><em>"Pharmacy staff are valued by doctors, nurses and patients on the ward, however it feels like it is not seen as an essential service by management teams. It is very difficult to get new posts - which are greatly needed.  "</em></li><li><em>"Within my department I do feel listened to and supported, however I am not entirely sure of how the wider trust views me as a person or just another number"</em></li><li><em>"I feel that services in the community are often forgotten - one example of many is when M&S were giving free lunches. Although this was something only small - as a service that has continued to work throughout the pandemic it would have been nice to have received something and at the time would have reminded us that we are a valued part of the wider BoltonFT workforce. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I have done this role for 29 years in the NHS and very proud to work with some very talented medics and staff.  I just feel that it is a shame we are not rewarded at times for our continued dedication to the trust.  I know this can not be shown in the pay scale but there are other ways of rewarding staff and making them feel valued without giving extra money.  Staff could be given a week at reduced hours as a thank you for all the hard work?  My colleagues in the department have shown great dedication during the past 3 months and all turned up every day working hard and I think we are feeling a bit undervalued but I am sure everyone else in the hospital at the moment might be feeling the same.  "</em></li><li><em>"I was off for several months just over a year ago with depression and felt pressurised into coming back to work and was promised every level of support when I returned to work.  This support disappeared the second I returned, I don't get asked how I am and even when I do I reply with "I have good days and bad" and it never gets expanded on.  Over the last few months due to the current circumstances of COVID-19 I have felt even more stressed and dread the thought of coming into work.  I am currently living with people who are highly vulnerable and shielding and under no circumstances has this even been acknowledged by the management team above me and feel that I have to use my own judgement on which tasks to complete throughout the day.  My colleagues have been very understanding of this and help me out whenever they can but then I feel worse for asking them to do these tasks to help me out.

My immediate supervisor has been brilliant with me throughout this time but management seem to be determined to break the unity of our team and only comment on the negative side of things and never even seem to acknowledge that we do work as a team"</em></li><li><em>"Feel like lab medicine is hidden away from the rest of the hospital, we are hidden behind doors but we, as a team, work tirelessly to achieve our turnaround times and sometimes go above and beyond to help colleagues and our users, give help and support when required.  We have a great team in Blood sciences.  I am proud and privileged to work with them all.  We work 24/7 and nearly all take part in the out of hours shifts."</em></li><li><em>"Whilst I enjoy my job very much,  more often than not, basic ward nurses seem to be treated as less important than others who wear 'specialist' uniforms.
"</em></li><li><em>"I enjoy my job, the team and area I work in which is why I feel motivated and work hard within the role. Unfortunately, from a wider trust perspective I don't feel motivated and enthusiastic for most of time which isn't in my nature. We are part of the ICSD - we are often left out of updates, decisions etc and the focus appears to be on the Intermediate Tier services, even prior to the current pandemic, this makes it difficult to feel part of the wider trust community. This has been highlighted to senior management numerous times yet there still appears to be no changes. We recently highlighted an issue which was picked up by senior management and the well-being team - the well-being team informed us they would be in touch the next day to see how we are were, this was during mental health week where there was a particular focus on staff mental health and well-being - we have heard nothing from the team and its been hard at times to maintain positivity for reasons such as this. Last year our team worked with two staff only from the usual seven due to long term sickness and vacancies - we were expected to maintain our service and complete non clinical duties for the majority of this time."</em></li><li><em>" Working for Bolton NHS Foundation Trust,  I feel very proud,  Over the past few weeks staff and colleagues have been working tremendously hard, we work well as a team and sometimes this is not highlighted enough, For staff to feel valued and proud.
I have worked for the Trust for nearly 30years and seen a lot of changes,  How staff are treated at times is not what our Trust values are, we need to enforce theses values and show our staff that they are a bit part of the Trust. Without the staff the Trust would not of got through these past few weeks, Staff have definitely gone the extra mile. 
saying Thank you goes a long way. "</em></li><li><em>"Despite being very happy in my role for a number of years recent developments at the Trust have made me question the organisations support and gratitude of non-clinical staff.  Despite on the surface the Trust trying to look like it cares about these staff it is fairly obvious in day to day observations they couldn't care less - unless the non-clinical member of staff in question makes themselves obviously known.  Admin and clerical day this year was once again forgotten about under the excuse of the pandemic but the current situation did not stop celebrations and thank you for nursing staff on International Nurses Day.

There is too much time spent by senior managers on Twitter telling each other how amazing they are rather than actually doing their jobs and encouraging staff who may not be on that social media platform.  This also provides some of the evidence of the clique culture there is at the Trust.  

There are too many awards being given out by both the organisation and divisions which means they end up losing any form of value.

I would like to add that my immediate line manager is very supportive and caring and this is in no way a reflection on them but the wider observations of the Trust at the moment.




"</em></li><li><em>"Organisational change of the 0-19/25 Service has resulted in loss of services,  roles and downgrading. This impacts on health and wellbeing of staff. Resulting in staff  feeling devalued, deflated and demotivated. This can then potentially impact on service productivity.
Furthermore the reduction of estates requires constant 'hot-desking' which can result in a less cohesive team spirit."</em></li><li><em>"Following re deployment due to Covid-19,I have returned to a very different job environment. The massive changes under the heading of "unprecedented times" are very unsettling and leave me feeling undervalued by the trust . The message is that we are very definitely not a priority workforce for this trust despite working in different fields ,at very short notice, during the pandemic and often being in close proximity to Covid-19 patients.
I am disappointed by how the return has made me feel.
I am generally a positive person and can see benefits to change but feel that this episode in our careers has been handled very badly."</em></li><li><em>"As a small and specialist team with complex patients the work we do feels as though it goes unrecognised, there isn't an interest in the work we do or the high patient satisfaction within the department what is seen is length of stay and numbers on a waiting list. The answer to this isn't to ask how we can do more for less which is what was asked of the team. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"It was verbally discussed in August 2019 that I would be stepping up a band as the work I had shown and additional responsibilities I had taken was beneficial to the team,  this talk occurred at the same time as another colleague. They received a step up in band a few months after. However, I am still waiting this agreed band increase and have been told recently that there is no additional money. I don't feel a valued member of the team and that my additional work is just being taken for granted. My additional manager has been very supportive in trying to secure this without any luck. I love my job but do feel undervalued by the trust. "</em></li><li><em>" We give full commitment to the trust yet I feel like I am just a number and not really a person.

No member's of senior management have been to speak to us about the plans for the future of the service and no apologies have been made for the fact the service has been massacred. As a small team we have worked really hard to keep our 500 patients informed and treated virtually throughout with little direction from senior management.

I no longer feel positive about my job and no longer look forward to coming into work. I don't feel valued as a member of the team by management and feel that the team as a whole is treated unfairly, not supported by management and not listened to compared to the other teams in the directorate. This has made me question my role and look for another role in nursing."</em></li><li><em>"In community we have been almost completely ignored during the Coronavirus pandemic. At the end of March we were each given one bottle of alcohol gel and one pack of wipes for each office. Packs of wipes were available if needed. People were worried and sometimes upset about having to come into work - a small meeting room was made available as a 'Lavender' room, that has since been taken away. On 18th June all the fabric covered seating in the staff room was deemed 'not for use' wooden tables and single chairs were placed sparsely. We were also instructed to wear face masks. We all feel that this is 3 months too late - never in 25 years of service have I felt so low and unappreciated. It's as if in community we are invisible. The trust used to be a much better place to work."</em></li><li><em>"I also feel that the service is forgotten or overlooked (I understand there are more pressing priorities) but this is currently leaving me feeling that my service/profession is not valued in this Trust.

I feel fully supported in my role and even though I do go above and beyond my role this is never expected of me.
I am part of a great team and hope to be working here for years to come."</em></li><li><em>"I do feel proud of how I adapted to the situation I was faced with and it has given me some transferable experience. "</em></li><li><em>"I'm lucky to enjoy my job whatever responsible role I've been in, there has been a few over recent years. I have a good work life balance and am enthusiastic about coming to work daily. I can honestly say have good resilience and not sure its just me or what I've gleaned from some excellent role models with a great work ethic over the years, suppose most of all Im proud to be a member of the organisation so going the extra mile is not really a mile at all."</em></li><li><em>"I work in a department where the majority of staff are a family, caring for and looking out for each other. 
I feel privileged to work here as I am able I to deliver a high standard of care to patients, including the little things like a few kind words or simply the holding of a hand of a anxious or vulnerable person. "</em></li><li><em>"I am very proud to say I work for the NHS and hope they are of me"</em></li><li><em>"I am proud to work for the NHS,  i am even more proud to work within imc@home, we do a great job  in rehabilitation and the outcomes of our work are very rewarding at times.  During this covid  period we have had to be very adaptable.   From a therapist we have had to become nurses,Carers,councillors,palliative support workers and friends to many needy people,  and very supportive to each other within our own little teams, we have dealt very well with lots of extreme changes, 7 day working, 12 hour days, moving our base, and of coarse the virus and what it brings with it.  "</em></li><li><em>"Given the current covid situation things are a lot different work wise, and people's energy levels and motivation to work isn't quite what it usually is. A lot of roles have changed and most people have had to adapt to a new way of working, but I think here in Bolton we have all been very good in just getting on with this. In general Bolton is a great place to work and I very much enjoy my role. The many different teams I work with are extremely supportive and make me feel valued. "</em></li><li><em>"I always like to strike up conversations with patients to put their mind at ease when they are anxious during assessment hoping to make them feel comfortable and reassured of good quality care and that all the staff are approachable."</em></li><li><em>"I always encourage my self at work and treat patient to the best of my ability. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"i enjoy working hard, i say to myself i have made a difference today for a better tomorrow"</em></li><li><em>"I travel 78 miles per day (round trip) to work at Bolton and would not want to work anywhere else. 
The response to the COVID - 19 surge demonstrated Bolton's ability to flex and embody the NHS at its best"</em></li><li><em>"I am proud to be part of the department I work for and my manager is one of the best."</em></li><li><em>"I feel that myself as an individual and the team I work with have stepped up our commitment to helping the people of Bolton and the Trust through this difficult times, and this in testing times for us with our own current job situation.  I feel that an attribute for working for the NHS is to be a caring person, to care about your colleagues, patients and the community.  "</em></li><li><em>"I am very proud to say I work for the NHS and hope they are of me"</em></li><li><em>"Work is stressful but i'm fulfilled in my job role and love my job. I always want myself and my team to do better and improve on our patient care always. I am proud to be part of team Bolton "</em></li><li><em>"Despite this, throughout the pandemic staff have continued to maintain service provision to those with acute needs and telephone support to other patients and latterly virtual support. Patients have communicated their appreciation of our support. The passion of team members to deliver a quality service remains unchanged but the challenges faced have questioned whether they are supported in this.  (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Increased workloads on a continuous level is leading to reduced patient care particularly with regards to end of life patients who deserve better.

However I feel the immediate senior team, my team, and others I work with have been friendly and welcoming, and are keen to celebrate staff achievements, show appreciation and offer development opportunities and they do clearly care about their roles and responsibilities. (Part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"I am passionate about my profession/ getting the best outcomes for patients. I feel that at times managers loose sight of the services and what they need to provide. Staff and teams need to be valued, cared about,communication needs to be clear, staff need to be listened to. The progression of staff  should not be at the detriment to the teams working under/alongside them.  Sometimes it feels that doing your job is made difficulty with the barriers that are put in place. Bolton is still a good place to work- but things could be better. There needs to be more focus on the services that provide long term interventions- not just those that provide acute interventions.

During this pandemic my managers have shown me kindness, support, shown me that they care, involved me, and kept me up to date with departmental and Trust information whilst at home. It is a superb place to work. They supported me in my previous role and continue to do so in my current role."</em></li><li><em>"I love my job, I intend to work if possible beyond my retirement age.

This has never resulted in any loss of service or attendance but I frequently experience massive feelings of anxiety and dreadful sleep. I rarely sellp on Sundays knowing the week is ahead of me.

I was found a role that I enjoy and that I feel has purpose whilst making sure I am being protected."</em></li><li><em>"Answers to questions are reflective of work in the pandemic period.  A period of unprecedented change where direction has had to be flexible and quick to react - therefore sometimes felt employees were trying to catch up, but that is understandable due to the pandemic"</em></li><li><em>"We went through a difficult period of transformation. Tt is difficult to know whether this has worked due to COVID."</em></li><li><em>"I have been redeployed during Covid - 19 pandemic so am not doing my usual role.
"</em></li><li><em>"I have been working from home since March due to Covid.  I am really enjoying working from home (I can do 100% of my job from home) as it makes me feel safer (my husband is shielded) and it saves me 2 hours a day in travelling to and from work.  I hope that flexibility in working patterns and locations can continue post Covid for people who want to work like this.  "</em></li><li><em>"Working from home has been a saviour for me and my enthusiasm for work. It's made me feel proud of our team and how well we all adapted to the huge change at such short notice. There's been no down side to home working for me and I'll be disappointed if we can't continue to do so."</em></li><li><em>"It's good to see the face of Bolton FT is transforming, I am really supportive of the estate uplifts and the 'For A Better Bolton' campaign. "</em></li><li><em>"I find that the elements of work that I enjoy and make a difference are often lost in the middle of keeping up with every new change that comes in which often seems to take me further away from face to face work and more connected to a computer."</em></li><li><em>"Staff are feeling undervalued and have concerns on how the changes will impact upon team dynamics and their working practices.
Despite this, throughout the pandemic staff have continued to maintain service provision to those with acute needs and telephone support to other patients and latterly virtual support. Patients have communicated their appreciation of our support. The passion of team members to deliver a quality service remains unchanged but the challenges faced have questioned whether they are supported in this (part of a larger comment)"</em></li><li><em>"Very stressful working. lots of changes continuously occurring. This makes things difficult when trying to adjust, just when things get settled new processes come into play.  Communication is poor from managers. "</em></li><li><em>"There have been a lot of changes within my department and a lot of new management which has caused a lot of stress and anxiety within my role"</em></li><li><em>"There have been numerous changes within the area that I work in the last 12 months with colleagues leaving post and several members of staff taking long term sickness absence. The atmosphere is not always positive."</em></li><li><em>"I am very happy with my role, team and management. During the Covid period we have had to adapt our work following guidance. This has highlighted that our service can work flexibly, including working from home. This has identified we can meet the need of families while allowing some flexibility with working parents. It would be great if some of these changes can be continued. 

Feedback and support is mainly from our band 7 who is always approachable and fair.  "</em></li><li><em>"My role has changed with business continuity/covid and I've had to be very flexible and cope with daily change, working within a service where processes are being developed alongside the daily work and are changing constantly, constant uncertainty and supporting staff with well-being. Whilst, my mangers are very accessible and try to be as supportive as they can - it can feel isolating working away from the main hub and having no support on sight. Temporary accommodation and challenges ongoing with building and space. Change in working patterns and expectations. Too much work to process and can lose track of what priorities need to be, which can change on a given day.   "</em></li></ul></span>

E.g. allowing therapist full time management of their diaries and pre booking appts and planning their own time according to demand and continuing with the response service. Alongside the previous community team, treating palliative complex patients, falls, IMC and hospital D/C, INT and COVID patients. Alongside fighting for PPE and unbelievable amount of change and now further extension to this work load and working pattern has been exhausting.
